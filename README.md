# Load_neutral.py
In load_neutral / load_non_neutral function, it requires two parameters, one is a model and the other is a dataset. The main goal is to divide the sentences in the raw dataset into two groups, neutral and non-neutral ones. The load_neutral function will return a sub dataset that contains only neutral sentences from the original dataset while the load_non_neutral function will return a sub dataset that contains only non-neutral sentences.
