1,Well_comma_ actually_comma_ I think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs.
1,yeah and maybe i should've gotten with her sister when i had the chance
1,Definitely_comma_ I'd look to move on if I was you.
1,That sounds really great and delicious! 
1,That's great! I'm a bit jealous.
1,At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.
1,Just the worst_comma_ it was one of my favorite gourmet ice creams too_comma_ salted caramel flavour

1,Oh they need to take care of that asap!
1,I tried to buy a part for my furniture but they changed the sizes and left the name the same
1,I totally understand. Well_comma_ the best we can do is power through. Only 8 hours left for me_comma_ at least!
1,Yes_comma_ it's much better than not making it.
1,Oh no_comma_ the dreaded fly being down for the big meeting. How'd it go?
1,Do you remember the title?  Maybe you can get another copy.
1,Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
1,Yeah_comma_ I wasn't careful about what I ate when I was younger_comma_ and I'm really paying for it now. Hopefully they can get back in shape too.
1,I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.
1,All of the food tasted so good_comma_ but I couldn't get over how recently they killed the courses. Still-moving octopus? No thank you.
1,That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!
1,Sorry to hear that.  Do you play soccer

1,Yeah i would have yelled at him
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm really nervous that they won't hire me. 
1,Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar?
1,It must be such a relief. I'm happy for ya.
1,I have been married for 14 years now. We've had our ups and downs_comma_ but a good relationship takes work.

1,Do you have someone to go places with you? Or do you just have to power through it?
1,I was training a new employee at work last night. She seemed pretty competent.
1,Well_comma_ I am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while he's still in high school. You just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine.

1,That's awful news! I don't want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance.
1,Im taking my daughter for school clothes
1,That is good to hear_comma_ I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster
1,Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie?

1,My son just finished high school.
1,I am trying to keep my cool but its pretty hard right now. 
1,I'm not sure if you live in an area with much traffic_comma_ but here in Atlanta it's an every day thing.  I was just sitting on the interstate the other day due to a wreck in front of us and I'd been there already for around 30 minutes.
1,I feel horrible. I did something bad. 
1,That's so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing_comma_ right?!
1,Wow_comma_ she is a keeper. What car is it?

1,How exciting! Where is your friend originally from?
1,My brother is starting his first semester at the college I wanted to go to but could never get into. I am very happy for him. He was scared to accept the offer at first because he thought he'd hurt my feelings. I told him that was crazy!
1,yea but it was a lonesome time
1,Oh really? How'd you find out?
1,It's so hard how that usually is the case. Never deserved. Is his surgery scheduled soon?
1,Are you a cop yourself
1,I am sure they did not mind doing that
1,You were prepared for sure. Did you get the grades yet? 
1,What did they find out?
1,I am happy for you.
1,And your hard work will pay off!
1,Is that a game ?
1,I guess I can always buy another.
1,"My co-worker just purchased a ford raptor"""

1,i was worried i might not pass and got scared
1,That is good that you have something to protect yourself with
1,What did she do for your birthday?
1,My school is low income_comma_ but we score in the top 5% statewide.

1,It was about 4 hours lots of time to enjoy it.
1,My family came all the way from Australia_comma_ and I don't really have time to show them around.
1,I can see that. I guess this is why we can't have nice things.

1,That's great! Is it a boy or a girl?
1,I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait_comma_ but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task. 
1,Maybe that's all he could spare for. Still got to stunt whenever possible. 
1,You know when you start something and you don't really see results til years later.
1,Did you get a chance to talk to them yet_comma_ and introduce yourself?
1,I was jogging a couple days ago and suddenly a bear came out of the woods!

1,Yikes! That made a mess I bet. Did you get burned?
1,I was holding my brother's newborn earlier today... I held them up a little bit_comma_ with them facing down at me_comma_ and they puked all over me. Pretty cool. Can't get the smell of baby vomit out of my nose.

1,I guess. Thanks for making me feel a little better about it.
1,Wow. You must be very proud
1,Thats funny.  I never did anything that daring!

1,That must've been terrifying in your dream.
1,When your teeth start hurting you know you are going to spend a lot of money.
1,Me too! I go through so much preparation just for the first day only. I want to make sure I do everything right!
1,I know. My friend sometimes gets very self centered. It can be a challenge.
1,Yeah_comma_ I guess you will have to budget next time
1,Yeah I wish she was mine though. I think I love her. 
1,He did! I was eating some bread_comma_ and it came out and I didn't even notice. He was trying to say it without saying that my tooth was missing.
1,I was at first_comma_ but I think it was hellish mix up. I'm working it out with them now_comma_ hopefully they don't nab with that money.

1,Saw a guy drop off a puppy on the side of the road once. Was a cute little lab puppy.

1,I lost my temper with my father and said some rude things I shouldnt have said when I was younger. 
1,We haven't set a date yet_comma_ but my heart is filled with happiness
1,Vacation is soon for me! I can't wait!
1,Can't agree more.  Although I probably shouldn't be so excited... it is *my* money.
1,I've been pet sitting for my mom while she is on vacation_comma_ and I've gotten close with one of her cats. She's just the sweetest little thing!
1,That's true. I wasn't really a child though! I was at university! We all have little devils inside us_comma_ I suppose.
1,I went to the bowling alley all by myself today. It was terrible.
1,Oh I wasn't stressed. It was amazing to get the tv for a great price when I was really short on cash that year.
1,I kinda miss them_comma_ and our schedule gets a lot busier when schools in.
1,That's amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life.
1,Where did he fly off too?
1,I do_comma_ but she was really abused before and was so docile and quiet..some never do learn normal animal behavior..I have rehabilitated many.
1,The kids wanted me to take them skating but I just didn't feel like it. So I told them I had something else to do. Later I felt bad for doing this.
1,Well done. I'm sure she'll appreciate it
1,got a great deal. check them out.
1,Well_comma_ maybe you won't do it again.
1,I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person_comma_ especially the good memories. 
1,All thanks to my Lecturer's without their help i wouldn't have made it!!
1,I got a cake in the conference room_comma_ but I was actually on vacation when they did it_comma_ bad planning on their part.  Otherwise just my normal paycheck.

1,Thank you! I hope to feel that content someday!
1,That's great! What job did you get?
1,That is exciting!   How long will it take before they give you and answer?
1,I will look but I hate it when they cancel good shows. It seems to happen too often.
1,I'm looking forward to the dining and drinking.  I can't wait!
1,Me too! I sat in the parking lot for an hour reading a self help book just to be able to 'fake it' by seeming outgoing.
1,I really hate when my kids take my things without asking
1,I did buy them gifts but still felt so nice to be appreciated.
1,I witnessed a man eat an entire 3 foot burrito the other day.
1,I was nervous driving this evening. The traffic was so bad
1,Wow! That's amazing! I'd love it if my parents got me gifts like that!!

1,I just had my first child a few weeks ago. I guess the distraction got to me and effected my performance.

1,ill try not to laugh_comma_ i promise.  Tell me about it!
1,Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection_comma_ but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.  
1,It's certainly not something I would want to live through again. I try to fly as little as possible these days
1,I have never been but once_comma_ to a trip in the Alps with my friends!
1,I'm so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect.
1,OH like a raise? If you worked hard they should give it to you
1,Yes_comma_ we do. He's a terrific guy. He said since he's single_comma_ he wanted us to be with our families.
1,What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker. 
1,I think that would help. Is it for vacation?

1,tomorrow we find out if we are having a baby boy or girl
1,I feel like I let my roommate down by breaking some of our house rules_comma_ and I feel bad for it.
1,Yeah_comma_ which is fine if we were just friends_comma_ but we're significant others and we plan to get married_comma_ so it's kind of worrisome that after years being together that we're not better at communicating_comma_ or at least working through an argument. It's hard for us to put aside our personal feelings and be objective_comma_ but only when it's with one another_comma_ for some reason.
1,Best toes in the USA.
1,Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.

1,I like the fact its light out longer.
1,My parents were able to pay for me to attend college_comma_ however I feel bad for those who were not lucky enough to be born into those circumstances

1,I forgot tosay jealous. oops. my car quit and i have to catch rides everywhere  nic cars upset me now.
1,Oh god_comma_ that is horrifying! I would've wanted to hide under a rock too!
1,I do. But I don't have any friends out here.
1,That's awesome! What sport is the team for?
1,I hear! I let depression get to me at times. I went in to the day hoping to get all of it done and I did. It's nice when you get everything accomplished you need too.

1,Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made. 
1,No_comma_ they're not_comma_ and it's not just in this country. Europe is terrible for dog poo in the streets!
1,I guess you got an A?
1,or hire more people maybe also
1,I can't wait to see it!
1,It was really gross to watch!
1,I tried to make small talk at my new job's onboarding and the lady ignored me.
1,"It did! That's the first thing that came to mind right before pulling it; ""PLEASE let this one work!""."
1,I got a check in the mail from my insurance company.   Wasn't expecting that!!
1,I would be feeling quite anxious if I were you!  I am sure it will work out for you!
1,It was around $100 or so. In the end_comma_ the value to me was more than the money.
1,I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time in person for 1.5 years because he's been serving in the Army. I'm excited but have butterflies too and am nervous about it.

1,It will happen eventually. Enjoy being single while you can.
1,Its going to be a lot of fun I hope
1,yep_comma_ hypergamy is a real killer
1,Our fence fell down. It's going to cost so much to get it fixed.
1,Working from home now gives me the chance to be with my daughter more.
1,I could not believe my eyes this morning. I saw my neighbor who loves to send us cupcakes pick his nose and put his finger that he just put inside his nose into his mouth!
1,I am so angry at myself lately.
1,I head foot steps and bangs and crashes in my house all the time._comma_
1,Not so much sad_comma_ as kind of thoughtful. I'm very proud of what he's accomplished in school and how he's taken charge of that aspect of his life.
1,When the girl leaned in for a kiss all I could see was my beautiful wife whom I love.
1,I am feeling pretty good after finishing that last exam.
1,Do you want to have kids in the future?
1,That is really awesome! I bet is a a relief that its done now!
1,Oh no_comma_ did you get hurt very badly?
1,I finally went on my first rollercoaster since I've never been to an amusement park. What's the deal with rollercoasters?! How is that fun_comma_ that's not fun_comma_ that's scary!
1,how so ? moneywise ?
1,I am! I haven't been in many years_comma_ so it will be fun to see how it's changed and to catch up with them
1,well_comma_ it was not about the eating but the fun i enjoyed as a kid.
1,ohh_comma_ that's so bad. It was not even your brother's fault. I really feel sorry for him.
1,Yea_comma_ we do. Does it sound like a bad thing?
1,I am already feeling better_comma_ but I hope everything is fine.
1,Yeah it definitely ruined the rest of my day.
1,Oh_comma_ that would not have been fun! They do not like people!
1,oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.

1,It seems the slot he took was the only one. 
1,No_comma_ I am so angry about it.
1,I can't believe I am up so early_comma_ it's the weekend!
1,some people are just so nasty.
1,That's good_comma_ I'm sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of.
1,I haven't even thought that far ahead_comma_ I just hope I win! Maybe a nice vacation?
1,Was she keeping him in her classroom? I can see how that can be a lot of work.
1,Yes_comma_ I applied but have been rejected as always. Maybe I need to try a new career field.
1,Really? I will definitely give it a try. My favorite tv show is stranger things
1,I have been in a relationship for a few years and its alright but its nothing terribly special
1,Uh oh. Did he ruin some furniture?
1,Oh sports...I have no idea about this subject. Lakers is basketball right?
1,That's a good way to look at it. But I know he's good looking_comma_ he's mine! Haha! 
1,They are_comma_ but if you save up a little at a time_comma_ it won't be that bad!
1,Oh my gosh_comma_ what did you do?

1,i was born in savannah!
1,He sounds wonderful and he sounds like he was a great companion and friend. :)
1,I'm not sure.  I thought I was more qualified than him.  It seems like I can never get what other have.
1,I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though. 
1,The a/c in my house wasn't working this weekend.
1,Was this a friend you were in love with_comma_ or just a best friend?
1,I hate driving in heavy traffic.

1,Just got my marks best for the test
1,Congratulations!  Studying really pays off!

1,That sounds pretty nerve-wracking. How did it go?
1,always great to see people youve been away from_comma_ happy early birthday!
1,Well_comma_ that sounds admirable.  Focusing on making money so you can be independent.  
1,Yes! My mom is crazy.
1,Well_comma_ then it wasn't too bad.
1,Bigger vehicles are so convenient for stuff like that!
1,I love it_comma_ I feel very good about myself now!

1,especially on hot summer nights!
1,Yeah_comma_ I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I don't know what dangerous marine life could be around me.
1,Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!
1,That's a great idea. I'll do that!
1,i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids
1,I am feeling positive about the economy these days
1,I'm disappointed in how my brownies turned out. They are so mushy!
1,I'll email you right away_comma_ keep a look out for that :-)
1,I wish I didn't cheat on my now ex-gf

1,Yeah I've always heard that about kiddos.  Congrats and good luck!  I'm sure you will be an awesome parent!! :D
1,many years ago when my wife and i first moved in with each other there were lots of debates about money
1,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
1,I had to tell my son the other day that our dog wasn't going to be with us anymore.
1,I agree_comma_ but I thought it was worth a shot. i am so sad I lost all that money.
1,I would be afraid one of them would get out!
1,I'm so proud my cat beat cancer.
1,I walked up on a snake in my back yard a few days ago.

1,Oh_comma_ I bet that is going to be fun
1,I found someone to tell. Apparently the kids has issues_comma_ but he should have been watched then!
1,That's an incredible blessing that they love you. Some people have different opinions about that so your lucky you come rom a supportive family.
1,For sure. I did not have any family down there though. I begged and had enough to not be homeless. It was a miracle. 
1,It's for a potluck.  I am sure I can do it well.
1,Is the person someone you know well_comma_ a long time friend_comma_ a family member?
1,We are hoping to buy a new house in the next year. Hopefully we can find what we want for the right price.

1,My cat is at the kitty spa.
1,My neighbors kept me up all night
1,"Did you feel any kind of ""presence"" or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture?"
1,You ever have one of those moments where it's supposed to be very challenging_comma_ but then it seems like you've been ready for it for years?
1,Me and this girl on Tinder seemed to really like each other until she randomly decided to ghost me.
1,Can't always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it_comma_ too!
1,I completely understand! They scare me and I become like a little girl! The rat snakes are great though...I would never hurt them..but I don't want them near me or in eye vision! lol
1,I stole from my parents and they caught me. I felt so bad as they yell at me. 
1,I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened?
1,Did they have a good reason?
1,Oh wow_comma_ You think you baby might be a little sick?
1,I'm sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.
1,I'm so not prepared for this presentation at work tomorrow
1,It was a random brain thing that got him instantly
1,I was very upset_comma_ and I wanted to speak with the manager about it. Customer service is so bad these days!
1,I took a trip over the weekend where we stayed at a nice hotel with a balcony overlooking the pool.
1,Hell no. thats family and she has an addiction. In can weirdly understand but thats why she keeps doing it.
1,Oh_comma_ that sounds so exciting! What did you make?

1,If the journey is tough then you are in the right path. So_comma_ she is heading in right way. Great.
1,I am too_comma_ it was a great game
1,That's good news. Congratulations in advance!
1,Even though I'm no longer Catholic I still put my faith in a Supreme_comma_ Higher Power because with all the dumb choices I've made in life it's a miracle I'm still here.
1,Yeah_comma_ I guess you're right. I need to stop pouting about it and get in the gym. I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye on my calories now.
1,Wow!  That's amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.  
1,I'm glad to hear it. What's got you so?

1,That's unfortunate. Maybe you can have a chat with them about it?
1,I am very excited today! 
1,I'm glad I let him fix it though. Car works great.
1,Where and when did this happen?  I haven't looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening.
1,I agree_comma_ you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans.
1,I like buying picture frames
1,I guess you're not at all attracted to her then?
1,I would cry_comma_ very much!
1,Oh that's hard but I'm sure you will get yours too. It's hard being patient though when others get theirs before you.
1,Now they are all going to be married.
1,I am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe.

1,What kind of hobby do you have?
1,oh no oh yes oh no oh yes!!!
1,I am hoping the new Pokemon game ends up being really good_comma_ I am not sure though

1,Wow_comma_ that sucks. Do you know if she will eventually? Can you trust her?
1,I'm not familiar with the hot light term_comma_ what does that mean exactly?
1,It's not my tree to cut down_comma_ unfortunately. I'd at least like to prunce it a bit; the silouette it makes at night looks a lot like a person outside my window.
1,No I can but I didn't want her to have it and not me.
1,I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too.

1,I'm very angry about my boss attitude to work
1,Yeah_comma_ friends are the best stress relievers. 
1,I'm so sorry.  I know it must be tough right now but it is happening for a reason.  Make your dreams happen no matter where it is!

1,I told something to someone that I had promised to keep a secret.

1,It's sad that you have such a small mind.
1,no. whenever we meet i will handover to him

1,I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work?
1,Babies are a treasure. Do you have any?

1,Eh_comma_ I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it?
1,It sounds like you had a good time though.

1,I'm sorry to hear that. 
1,Oh yea? Where ya headed?
1,I really did!  It is an all expense paid trip for 6 days.  I haven't had a vacation in about 6 years.  I don't usually win contests though.

1,You made your coach proud and your family.

1,I know thats what makes it so bad
1,I feel great! I killed it on my math test.
1,They are mentally ill and the mood swings can be a bit much and seem intentional...as they tend to take it out on me..When they are being good though..it's hard not to be compassionate

1,Did you find anything great?
1,I have a new storm shelter and food. But I didn't get anything to play with for the storm.

1,That's awesome! What did you have done?
1,I never knew what to expect at these bachelorette parties...as a male stripper I always expected some lonely old cat ladies looking for company...but almost every single time they turned out to be gorgeous chicks in their 20s
1,Yes I guess I am.
1,That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
1,Yes_comma_ i thought she would disown me but she ended up supporting me.

1,I am as well. Even if it is a simple thatched roof.
1,Someone asked me to come pick them up at a specific place at a specific time. I was a little busy at the time_comma_ but I relented. Then they sat there and took 30 minutes longer than they said they would_comma_ and I had to sit around waiting in the car. How are people that inconsiderate?

1,He really is! He sacrificed his entire weekend just to get me this puppy.

1,I have been feeling a little sad lately
1,The other week it sounded like a bomb went off. I am in a very dangerous city_comma_ so you never know here. Between the gunshots and fireworks..AND fire balls..it's hard to tell!
1,Does he have a sister? lol
1,I did. My daughter is almost my size. Reminded me that she is growing up on me...
1,I was totally freaking out the other day after I watched a scary movie!
1,They ran some tests and could not pin point what was wrong so he is just taken it easy. I decided to take a weekend and go over and finish the garden. He was pretty happy about that.
1,I guess not because the surgery didn't work so we have to put her down.
1,I met Elton John at one of his concerts because I brought him flowers to the stage. Not an easy task.

1,It's always exciting when you know a package is on the way!
1,A few were seniors..others..too young but had been with me for a few years. It's been a rough year but I will always take care of them even when it's hard for me- They deserve it.

1,I came home today and my whole house was clean.. 
1,I am a math teacher in high school.

1,Well it took some time for me to cope up because I really put a lot of efforts_comma_ however I got to understand that it should be rather taken as a learning experience
1,Does that make you curious to look elsewhere? It sounds like it's maybe not the best place?
1,Ohh gosh! What happened. That's so terrifying
1,Especially in ours the drivers are terrible here no one uses the signal light! Thanks! 
1,Yeah_comma_ if it is a bad neighborhood I suppose.
1,My niece went there and loved it. Are you flying in or taking a cruise?
1,Thing very carrefully before making this important decision.
1,Oh no_comma_ I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well_comma_ though?
1,I killed it_comma_ and burned it.
1,"Record it and have a ""Office Space"" moment with it lol"
1,That's really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her co-worker.

1,Thats a smart idea! Thank you! I should try to combine forces...haha
1,I think you will do okay! Get as much rest as possible tonight just in case they do an interview!
1,Yeah_comma_ it was such a simpler time. Being an adult sucks so much ha ha! I guess I should plan a road trip like that with my own children. 
1,I've been planning this vacation for a while. Think I've got everything covered for a good time.
1,That is pretty awesome! I wish i could do stuff like that.
1,Yeah_comma_ gotta cut her out of my life. Loyalty is so important in a friend.

1,My dog bit a lady's dress_comma_ it made me feel very ashamed_comma_ she was almost naked in the street
1,When I was little my grandma gave me a little ceramic cat.
1,i had to send my food back at the resturaunt today
1,Oh no! Hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach.
1,I know right!  Those were the good old days.
1,Lol. Why didnt' you just reschedule?
1,I just applied for a promotion_comma_ and I should earn at least 10k more.
1,Put it to some good use.
1,Oh my God that's terrible!  So sad.  I'd be mad too.  What did you do?
1,Its a soulf food restaurant. Its been around since I was a kids

1,I think my brother's children are going to have to be put up for adoption soon. He and his wife just aren't fit for parenting_comma_ as they fight and get drunk all the time.

1,my current employer is so comfortable and i have my peace of mind here. i have work life balance
1,I am_comma_  but I have to attribute most of it to my wife putting up with me for so long.  She is a saint!
1,I was always afraid of going to sleep as a kid. Thought I would wake up with bigfoot skinning me alive.
1,You will find the right one someday.
1,They are the company. They only have a support button.

1,He was 5. I hope he is in a better place now.
1,That's so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor

1,the kids go back to school
1,I love dogs! I bet you were so happy.

1,I hope it's nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be. 
1,I live pretty minimalist. I have the things I need to enjoy life_comma_ like a home gym and a gaming computer while being able to afford living essentials. It doesn't take much for me to be happy.
1,I feel you. My 13 year old is the worst.
1,Understandable_comma_ when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling.
1,Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey_comma_ we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today.

1,I am looking forward to the next Star Wars movie.
1,Thanks.  We have been very committed to our wedding vows since day one.
1,I'm sorry_comma_ that made me laugh. Never really seen a parrot speak that well before. Thought it as just something you see in movies. Does it say anything else fun?
1,Oh you know_comma_ because of people. They try and get you down. I have been around a misery loves company type. I am really trying to hold on to that feeling no matter what. It's hard!
1,Yea haha_comma_ its all about putting that jealousy to self improvement while still rooting for them.
1,Oh awesome! What kind of puppy are you getting?
1,Yes_comma_ I'm glad it went smoothly. Not all companies are like that

1,he ate it alone ... burger was free cause he ate it all and a pound of fries.. and got a free tshirt
1,I voted for city council and clerks. 
1,This is normal_comma_ maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation. Anger  can make you do things that you will regret later. 
1,I let my daughter go shopping for school clothes with her friends today
1,Yes but I want to make trouble. He is trying his best but he didn't succeed.
1,I now the feeling_comma_ I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasn't too tough for her.

1,"I'll be sure to check this out! My brother has a switch I can ""borrow""!"

1,I bought everything I needed for the camping trip. I was not going to forget anything at all
1,Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it_comma_ or your boss?

1,I think you will do pretty well then in a street fight.
1,I hope you are feeling better.

1,My boss earns way more money than me for less work.
1,True.. but_comma_ who knows... maybe you'll make a new friend.
1,Yes_comma_ that was horrible what he did. I couldn't imagine what I would do if I had my child ripped from me
1,That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?
1,Oh no! Were you all by yourself?
1,It really is.  Wonder how we can go about changing things.

1,That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live.
1,I had tried chatting up this cute German girl at a hostel I used to live at but she just kept ignoring me.  I thought she hated me until she just opened up one night...and let me get to second base...mind blown I've just accepted I'll never understand women 
1,My dad didn't invite me to his wedding_comma_ talk about an all time low.
1,My girlfriend secretly booked a cruise for us next week. She told me today.
1,I am too scared though. I don't like horror films at all
1,Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun.
1,It happens sometime. Just try not to forget next time.
1,Yes I love to relax and have fun with friends.
1,that's good confident works miracles
1,I got him a new gas grill.
1,Well_comma_ after a few days of getting worse_comma_ took him to his primary dr.  He gave antibiotics for a sore throat.
1,That's pretty neat. Where is it at?
1,That's great. How did she do by the end of the day?
1,I certainly hope so_comma_ that would be awesome!
1,No_comma_ not this year.  We are going to dinner outside in a vineyard that is local to us.  I'm really looking forward to it.
1,Well that is step in the right direction at least
1,I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie to come out. I love Star Wars more than anything!
1,It is_comma_ you have never heard of it?
1,That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well?
1,Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first. 
1,My sister really gets on my nerves. She was supposed to do me a favor
1,Last week_comma_ my car glass was broken by someone
1,i have a coworker that comes into work late every day and takes way too many breaks
1,My niece lives in Los Angeles. I do not get to see her very much.
1,I think so_comma_ that must be the case
1,Thats great I happy for you. Its a positive step.
1,Oh_comma_ that is exciting. How big is your house?
1,I just bought my dream house at the beach!  I'm moving there next week!
1,She was thrilled. It was just a small gesture to show her that she is loved.
1,I am glad that you got it cleared up.
1,Oh man that's my favorite! Did you bring home a doggy bag to eat later?
1,a general worker_comma_ but i dont feel confident about it.
1,Did he do any damage?
1,The Christmas lights around the neighborhood_comma_ the cold_comma_ the jazzy music_comma_ and everyone coming together and sharing presents and time with each other! It's an excuse for everyone to come home!
1,that's nice_comma_ wanna share this wonderful experience with me?
1,Yeah he did but i felt bad cause he threw the fax machine into the kitchen. This was a heavy machine by the way.
1,I look at my facebook memories every day
1,I don't watch the tv. I can hear it sounds pretty bad though and I forecast that it could become a tornado!
1,Went to trim my beard today. Trimmed a little too much on one side_comma_ had to even it out on the other. Did that like four times on accident_comma_ and now I trimmed my beard so much more than I wanted to_comma_ and I look dumb.
1,I want to do something but haven't decided what yet. It will be 18 years for him and this is her first which makes it especially hard.
1,Yes_comma_ I love 80s rock n roll.
1,Thank you so much!  It's going to be awesome!
1,This year_comma_ the company I work for_comma_ provided with 10 days of paid vacation. I took a trip to Miami. It was amazing to visit the beaches
1,I know. The game was full of intrigue. They truly deserved the win
1,That's a smart move_comma_ that would reduce the risk of injury.
1,There's a restaurant I go to often with my family. After all these years_comma_ they're closing down.
1,yea i just hope they can beat the warriors
1,That is about as bad as it can get right there. I think you might have to tell her. The guilt will eat you alive.
1,Why was he doing it
1,I got lots of cool stuff and I had no idea they were planning it!
1,That's good_comma_ it's a lot of work_comma_ sure you are ready for that?
1,This is going to make me sound like a chicken_comma_ but I've got a neighbor whos twice my size and a little bit of a rage case. His fence is falling over into my yard.
1,We have 100 people coming over soon to pray over my sister and her house. I'm excited!
1,Nah it was my wife's.  I can't stand it when she just dumps her plates in there without scraping off the food.
1,it was suprising to see my dog find his way home the other day
1,As I was sleeping_comma_ my burglary alarm went off. It frightened me. 
1,Well it looks like you survived!
1,My neighbors got a new puppy yesterday.
1,They do_comma_ plus we simply dont have enough people_comma_ so its a good fill in.
1,It is and it wont change not even in my house 
1,Oh_comma_ how did you like it?
1,Oh are you a teacher?
1,what subject is it in?
1,It is very hard. I live alone now so it makes it hard especially at night. I keep hoping so! As he has so many deep rooted issues.
1,Good for her. Never too late to go back to school.
1,Oh_comma_ sorry to hear that. Hope you'll get well soon.
1,That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.
1,I just moved to a new city and I do not know anyone.
1,Oh wow that is great_comma_ is he feeling better since showing improvement?
1,That's really sad.  I hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days.  
1,That would be great. Good luck.
1,Congratulations on the good raising of the kid! I bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories.
1,Haha_comma_ yes you are totally right! I am sure they will forget about it soon :) 
1,I guess nowadays with how everything is going_comma_ it just feels like rush_comma_ rush_comma_ rush. Gotta sink or swim
1,Which chemistry class are you taking?
1,I hope it tasted good!
1,Cool I'm glad it was a success.  I hope it reminded you of good times!
1,Sometimes it is difficult to talk to relatives. Take a deep breath and treat her like a long time friend.  
1,I don't think he's dangerous. He just always want to talk about the past or getting back together. Im not interested.
1,Good thing nothing bad happen! I would be so devastated if my phone got stolen like that!
1,Absolutely_comma_ I felt bad but the company I was working for did not offer the same benefits of the new company.
1,Oh my lord! How are you still alive?
1,I think I would have been escorted out lol
1,He hadn't had cablein so long they are singing all new songs. This is going to be fun
1,What made you doubtful that you would get paid back?
1,I am nervous about going on this date tomorrow.
1,Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit. 
1,Thats the fun part lol
1,Just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better!
1,I know! It is just crazy how time flies. I know he will do great things.
1,oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard.
1,That's good man there will be more trust me.
1,I know_comma_ it's awful! How much did your rent go up?
1,Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool
1,My son had a jiu jitsu competition a couple weeks ago. He placed third.
1,I was terrified to walk home from the bar one night. 
1,That's great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything_comma_ which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship.
1,I recently changed jobs for a better opportunity with more pay. I'm very pleased with the new job_comma_ but I did feel bummed about leaving my former co-workers behind. We had a good time and I liked those kids.
1,Last weekend at walmart the cashier gave me too much change_comma_ even though I noticed this i kept it
1,I'm disappointed with my new tablet I got_comma_ it bugs and restarts like every 30 minutes. Might need to take it back.
1,I ate the last one of my wife's favorite cookies.
1,I think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.
1,Too bad you don't have a pond you can throw it into.
1,Yeah_comma_ I have had some legendary hangovers. I try to moderate better these days haha.
1,Good for you.  There's nothing quite like the sense of pride assocaited with building something!
1,It's rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything.
1,They say some of the smartest people are procrastinators.
1,Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it?
1,Probably the worst time of my life was when my second marriage ended. It lasted over 20 years and much of my life and plans for the future were intricately bound within that relationship.
1,It's not salvageable. I'm still mad.
1,I know what you mean lol
1,I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together.
1,Well_comma_ her creative side came out in the meal and we had alfredo sauce on our eggs - it was NOT good.
1,My brother just graduated college with honors. 
1,Great_comma_ I hope you get it.
1,My students have a big test coming up to see if they can move to the next grade. I think they'll do great! I made sure they were well prepared.
1,well yeah but it was only a mercedes_comma_ I thought he was gonna get me a lamborghini...
1,Mw too. I don't even llike when it's too dark inside or outside.
1,It  is a mauve. Lipstick queen! I can't always afford much so it's always nice when I can afford lipstick lol! especially a healthy kind.
1,I don't really have much time_comma_ but maybe I should make some for it.
1,That's the best part. Some people are in so much pain it's a relief for them to go. Hard on the families though. 
1,I'm so happy for her! Hopefully everything goes well for her
1,Looking at pictures of a recent vacation I took with my girlfriend to the Colorado Mountains. It stinks because we're long distance_comma_ so not only do I have to be sad about the vacation being over_comma_ but also sad about being far apart again. But at least seeing the pictures brings back great memories
1,Oh no_comma_ what happened to your cat?
1,Well better be careful_comma_ you might end up opening someone else's mail lol
1,It was really nice to experience some nostalgia.
1,I asked my sister_comma_ but she doesn't has the times
1,Well_comma_ he sounds like he really loves you.
1,Holy cow_comma_ that's a large limit! And I thought my $2500 limit was decent!
1,I mean yeah_comma_ it can't hurt_comma_ can it? I'm sure they'll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa. Plus_comma_ who knows? Your new best friend might be in there for all you know!
1,Did you fix it so that they won't lose their property in the future?
1,I bought a set of DVDs for the old 1970's Land of the Lost TV series. 
1,Oh no! Was she okay_comma_ or did she cry?
1,Awesome.  Is she going to university after?
1,You must have had trouble sleeping that night!
1,Keep doing what youre doing!  I think youll keep moving up that company ladder in no time
1,Lots of water and no soda. yikes
1,Yeah_comma_ it just sucks because I have a high deductible!
1,it is nice when it happens
1,We were two at the bus station. I told the woman to get away. She pretend he doesn't exist because he was behind her. It was disgusting.
1,I get it_comma_ I think I'd like to go back and relive the big events. I miss those the most_comma_ football games and dances.
1,Good idea! And if ever you go back_comma_ just take it slow and easy.
1,Yeah he does pretty well. He's a good kid.
1,I wish i could afford a vacation like that.
1,I know_comma_ but when it rains it pours. I'm just glad I have you to talk to.
1,Elementary. They didn't look to happy. I jhope they had a good summer_comma_ cause its over now lol
1,Thankfully_comma_ we were away and nothing was taken_comma_ but our security was gone.
1,nice_comma_ did you beat him up?
1,It was pretty great. I made them look like amatures
1,i hate being the only person at the bar_comma_ even if it is 10 a.m.
1,Going roller coaster riding for the first time this weekend
1,I am glad to hear you are alright. But I would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.
1,So true. And I feel so much better now that I am not even looking
1,I ordered a gift for a friend and it says it was delivered but I never received it. Now the company says it takes 14 days for a refund
1,Sounds like a great lady.  I am glad you are appreciative of her 
1,I saw someone eating something they picked up from the trash
1,I was happy to relax this weekend. I felt content
1,I went to make a sandwich one day and the entire laof of bread was covered in mold!
1,Family in a way. That is great that you have grown as a person! It is rare. They complain when they have things good and still aren't happy when it's bad?- I don't get it- I don't get people who want to stay in misery
1,Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out?
1,my friend went back with her ex again. 
1,Well_comma_ if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didn't take you on purpose.
1,Yes_comma_ but I do not know if it's jealously_comma_ or regret that I did not make the same decisions that he did. 
1,You might be right_comma_ I'll look into this. Thank you.
1,My daughter hides food under her bed_comma_ how nasty!
1,I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people.
1,Yes_comma_ and my family was too stubborn to evacuate_comma_ but I think the shutters kept us very safe 
1,I drove by the town i grew up in and made a few stops. it was a good time
1,Same. If only we could just put them in abadoned malls or something.
1,It was our senior year....
1,that sucks!! you should have been really annoyed with the delivery boy!
1,I got onions on my burger I order today and I hate onions
1,5 eh? Good - that's my favourite number!
1,I'm feeling a bit better everyday. He was always really good to me and my mom growing up_comma_ so I still miss him.
1,Sounds like you're burned out. Where ya going?
1,Not if I don'te eat them. There were so many onions on that burger.
1,I get nostalgic when I think about times with my parents in the past. A lot of different get togethers make me feel that way
1,Did you get in trouble with anyone?
1, My friend told me she didnt have enough money for rent and that she needed to borrow some money. 
1,Going on vacation to the beach!
1,How old is she now? why do you miss her baby stage?
1,Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?
1,My daughter was also but I didn't want to put any pressure on him since all kids are so different and it didn't matter.  But he astounded me and loves reading and writing.  
1,No_comma_ but it was close. Talk about road rage.
1,That's really to bad.  I hope the medicine works well and you are back to normal very soon!
1,People come into our lives for a reason sometimes.
1,We had to pick flowers and cake.
1,I just felt like I barely did bad enough to not get a B in the class and that's what happened.
1,What store will you go to?
1,oh wow that is gross.
1,Lol- cats are picky- Here I have a bunch of animals so someone will always like it. She won't leave her cage though and stays curled around her puppy all day and the blankets I have weren't cutting it so she seems more comfortable now- She is in a cage because she feels safer- she was trying to bite other animals.
1,I went to pick up my car from the mechanic and found a huge scratch on the side! They are saying they didn't do it! I am so mad right now!
1,Keep it that way. If too many people find out it might ruin the experience.
1,I went to a magic show last week. The magician was really talented.
1,They love you don't they?
1,Yeah I haven't either.  I bet it's gonna be awesome.  Bring plenty of beer :D
1,I tried so hard but in the end I failed.
1,My mom gave me a box of old toys I used when I was a kid.
1,"I was walking alone one night and a puppy started following me. It was so cute. I didnt know what to do."""
1,I was supposed to go on a trip over the weekend_comma_ but I didn't go.
1,I went on what I thought was a horrible interview. They called me today with an offer! that caught me completely off guard.
1,Thanks! Yes_comma_ it was very fun. Cake and all that.
1,I understand that. I live by a college. All the insanely cute girls are always around at every shop_comma_ restaraunt_comma_ and bar.
1,My daughter was thrown from her horse a few months back.
1,Did he pass? At least you got to appreciate him and show him your love
1,I have not been in the best mood today.
1,That is wonderful! Great wait to start the upcoming holiday season.
1,Oh boy I am livid! I just got this new couch from my family and my cats have already shredded an entire side of it.
1,I agree. I'm sure Lakers fans are thrilled!
1,Hi! Have you been to a rodeo?
1,MY mom had moved across town. She would drop me off at school and I would have to walk there after. 
1,i hate sitting around doing nothing. it drives me nuts to do nothing at work when i have a million things to do at home
1,I am so ready for Thanksgiving.
1,I have a big test coming up.
1,I love when that happens!  Good_comma_ its about time you got it.  I hope you enjoy whatever you're doing with the time off!
1,I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
1,Thank you.  That's so sweet of you to say.  They were parakeets named Snowball_comma_ Curacoa_comma_ and Panda.  I think the best thing for me to do is get another one soon to continue to enjoy their sweet personalities.
1,Yeah? Who were they playing against?
1,He did! I was very inspired by the act!
1,My nephew took me riding with him after he got his drivers license. I had to believe that he would keep us safe.
1,At least you had a lot of fun
1,Hahaha Sorry I just assumed you were 5 years old or something.  Yeah getting practical gifts is more appealing as one gets older.
1,I don't really know. He just stopped answering the calls. I am very disappointed at him being so irresponsible
1,no but im sad about it
1,That's definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since!
1,I went off of my keto for a two days and I feel a bit bad about it- I ate a bag of cheetos over two days. They were organic anyhow
1,I would have cried for multiple days!
1,Well this isn't the first time he's called. I was irritated_comma_ he won't leave me alone!
1,It was a bad experience for sure
1,Yes_comma_ but they couldn't identify the person
1,Me too. I have one more day
1,The chicken feed_comma_ apparently. The neighbors usually feed them every morning_comma_ and they were waiting expectantly.
1,Oh no_comma_  How long did he live?  is he still alive?
1,He is just aging and it is hard for him to move around. We had a great visit!
1,Oh no_comma_ your a/c isn't working?! This is a bad time of year for that!
1,That is awesome_comma_ thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language! You deserve to be appreciated_comma_ but I'm sure they appreciate you a lot.
1,Nice. I have my eye on a Tesla.
1,I went into that interviewing knowing i could answer any question they threw at me
1,Yes_comma_ he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves.
1,It's worse when you don't really understand what you are seeing.
1,That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
1,Looks like it. I was so afraid that I instantly called the police and went to my neighbors house until they arrived. 
1,Well_comma_ luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with_comma_ especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one_comma_ especially because oftentimes the shorter they are_comma_ the better
1,Aww that is sweet are you going?
1,I did_comma_ but my mother wasn't around.  My grandmother filled in for her though.  I'm so thankful for her willingness to help me grow up.
1,My husband and I were out to dinner with some coworkers of mine and my husband farted right in the middle of it.
1,Does she compensate you or anything like that?
1,It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  I'm glad you have a friend like that.
1,I don't blame you.  It's definitely hard to do. It's good for them to know that you are relying on them to do the right thing though.
1,How long did it take to write? I always admire the stamina of people who can write a book. 
1,Its a teaching exam so that I can teach special needs students.
1,God's Plan! Do you know why he did it?
1,oh my! does she know it is broken?
1,That will be nice.  Having a side gig really helps a lot as long as it doesnt take too much time
1,Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains
1,wow thats quite rude of them
1,He has a warrant_comma_ but Im used to him not paying so no lol
1,I undersand. Do you want to strangle me?
1,I'm pretty satisfied with all the house work I got done today. Yard is mowed and the house is clean!
1,I miss my family members as they all pretty much gone now...
1,Aww!  Tell me about it will you?  
1,You must be so happy! What kind of car?
1,I felt bad when I missed my cousins wedding. I had no excuse and I still feel bad
1,Sometimes life does have away with getting away from us
1,i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
1,Movies can be emotional_comma_ do you remember the film?
1,I was! Thankfully a coworker helped me change the tire. I don't know what I would've done without him!
1,Thank you. I hope we don't get hit again this year.
1,She told me that we were gonna have a pop quiz in physics that day and we did so I was more prepared for it because of what she said.
1,These people would hit your car and not even leave a not and say sorry or leave their insurance info
1,I was in the park the other day and dropped some money on the ground without knowing it. A kind stranger witnessed this happen and picked up the money. That person then returned it to me.
1,What charities do you like to give too
1,yikes thats quite a sum of money
1,That's awesome. How'd he do?
1,Me too. What are your plans?
1,I remember that too_comma_ it's interesting transitioning to a more independent lifestyle.
1,We had a really nice time_comma_ rode some rides_comma_ listened to some music.
1,I just ate 3 donuts by myself
1,I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.
1,It's about 6 years old now I think. Nah_comma_ I built a new one since then.
1,Wow I'm glad you were okay! I'd be so scared too.
1,Yeah i hope we dont get another one of those again
1,Oh yea? why is that?
1,Why does that no longer happen?
1,Yes! Thanks for listening! It's making me more excited! haha
1,Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast_comma_ i have two_comma_ a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls

1,I am pleased that I got to meet Donald Trump.
1,I think it was. I was too freaked out. Just ran inside.
1,Prom sounds exciting.  Do you have a date?
1,I bet it's going to be hard to fit in culturally_comma_ are you religious?
1,My boyfriend proposed last night!!
1,That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?
1,Oh man well thankfully I was born with adamantium cartilege...because she wasn't complaining she literally just left bro
1,Sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind_comma_ who knows you might ace the test .
1,thats always good when they cant wait to return
1,How about our president huh?
1,I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin
1,neither do I_comma_ but i seen it with my own eyes. 
1,It was about 7 years ago_comma_ but it still stings

1,That's the way to do it_comma_ clearly.
1,I had to ask my teacher if she would mind going over a assinment again with mme

1,gotteeeeeeeeeeeem_comma_ not but it was a pain to deal with
1,I wanted to look beautiful to go to church_comma_ so I did some things
1,Yeah_comma_ that really sucks. At least it's easier to keep up with people online these days.
1,Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up.
1,I've been sick and it's been hard to take care of my 3 kids during the day. My husband came home early from work to help out_comma_ I'm so thankful for him.
1,A major health win for me_comma_ I quit smoking a few weeks ago after 30 years.
1,Oh no_comma_ I hate when that happens.  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well.  How long did you have to wait?
1,A friend that I had during college came to visit me last week. I was not expecting him to contact me. It has been at least ten years that we didn't see each other.
1,actually they gave me my $20 dollar bill back plus change of the 20
1,I work as a Paramedic and I try to approach each patient as if they were my grandmother. 
1,You must be very hungry
1,I like the fact you ha to rewind after viewing.
1,Yeah.  She had diabetes and we had to give her insulin.  And she was blind for 4 years so I guess it was time.
1,Aw. I do that too. I still have my old cell phones with videos of mt babies doing nothing lol
1,That's a great way to look at it- take advantage of their investment for now- and then later you can have your own pool!

1,Funny_comma_ but true. Have you ever been to the races before?
1,That really sucks. Maybe you should get another job?

1,Oh really? And why is that?

1,I'm too poor to do either_comma_ so I'll just have to keep suffering along.
1,Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment?
1,Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain_comma_ a open wound_comma_ and itchy scabs_comma_ and the left over scar.

I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing.

1,I did not have enough money to take my son back to school shopping.

1,You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol 
1,Again I walked in on my brother with all my desk drawers open!

1,Yeah_comma_ that's what I think every time I see them - it's hard to be myself around them.
1,I miss my old dog_comma_ I was thinking about getting another one but I'm not sure.
1,When I was younger I had been trying to get pregnant for a long time_comma_ but wasn't having luck. Suddenly my husband and I found out we were going to have a baby. We were so happy. 
1,wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though

1,That's terrible. Are you guys still friends?
1,I've always been able to trust my wife and daughters.
1,They can be a handful. They're not the most socialized_comma_ so especially when we have other children over_comma_ they don't quite interact well_comma_ and they easily misunderstand situations. But I do appreciate the brotherly bond they have. It's something to be envious of.
1,Aww that's awful.  Do you have to move like for a job or something?
1,I already told her. The landlord also told her  but she does care
1,I wish I can win like you_comma_ I have never won anything before

1,I am very certain about my girl's love for me
1,I used to love playing the old pokemon games_comma_ I still bust them out every once in awhile for a throwback
1,I agree_comma_ I am not sure how people can do that to each other
1,My friend's new pet kitten tragically got hit by a car this past weekend. I felt so bad for her.

1,I still have quite a few student loans to pay.
1,Hopefully your insurance will help out.

1,It really is. I was caught off guard by the compassion and ability to take all the frenetic activity going on around her in stride and stay calm and talk to the children respectfully_comma_ trying to teach them instead of just yelling at them. I don't know if I'll be that good when I'm a parent.
1,i hope you have many more
1,What subject is it in?

1,That's nice to hear! What's going on in your life?
1,My girlfriend and I had an argument this afternoon_comma_ while she's about to go away to see relatives for a week. It's kind of a bummer because we don't really communicate that well_comma_ especially when it comes to arguments. It usually devolves into us rather not talking instead of trying to fully speak out our issues.
1,I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.
1,August is coming to an end. I always go back to my childhood when the last week before school starts were some of the most exciting times of my young life.
1,The first thing I made in pottery class was supposed to be a mini cactus pot. I use it as an ashtray now lol

1,I recently got the news that my grandfather has cancer. I was so had to hear that because he is a great guy and doesn't deserve it.

1,Does your boss call on you a lot?
1,I can't stand it when my wife hugs other men. I know it doesn't mean anything_comma_ but still.
1,Yeah_comma_ i hear you.. I can see how that can invoke envy.. you'll get there soon
1,Next week is going to be freaky!
1,I don't think that 's very healthy. 
1,It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon..

1,Oh wow_comma_ your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know they'll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha.
1,I feel the same way! Prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states.
1,That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel?
1,That's too bad. Do you mow a lot?
1,Are you going to have a surprise party?
1,My daughter passed out one day last week.
1,I have never been_comma_ but i would be very unhappy about it.

1,They just called to catch up.  I hadnt heard from her since she oved to AZ 5 years ago
1,I was a Realtime Manager in a contact center.
1,Yes_comma_ I know I wouldn't mind riding the donkey or mule down there.
1,Definitely_comma_ it's good to work for a company that does that too
1,I'm really sorry to hear that :( What happened? I'm here for you if you wanna talk
1,It was very embarassing. There was people looking at me and other laughing at me.
1,Maybe her body clock is out of whack.
1,Yup. Enjoy it whilst they're young! 
1,I wonder how my ex got such a pretty girlfriend. He doesn't look that great.

1,that's what it said in the youtube video
1,I was invited to a friend's party the other night.

1,Two daughters and one son

1,I just got my vacation approved by work. I leave next week. Im getting real antsy though.
1,it's annoying isn't it? You're expecting a check or something else to be delivered to you based on what you were told and yet it looks like that schedule won't be adhered to. That's where I was a few weeks ago.
1,remember those old AOL disc that they use to spam us with in the mail ? i saw one at a fleamarket
1,There was supposed to be a party this weekend_comma_ but it got cancelled.

1,That was really nice of your neighbor. I wish i had one like that
1,Well it sounds like it was your fault then I would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food! lol
1,I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work.

1,My grandma fell sick_comma_  and I have been the one taking care of her

1,I feel so bad for you.
1,I was speeding but didn't get caught. I feel bad thou.

1,I feel upset that someone I know would throw away progress constantly.
1,I got really down this morning. I saw a treehouse on the side of the road and it made me remember mine.
1,I haven't found out yet.  It makes me want to track the person down and give them a piece of my mind!
1,So thankful for good friends
1,Oh little mistakes like that happen_comma_ it's no big deal!
1,Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?
1,Oh that is definitely something to be excited about!
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm proud of her. But sometimes I feel like she's enabling him and acts as a crutch for him. Don't know if it's my business to say so_comma_ though
1,I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.
1,mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though_comma_ rich or poor. i dont eat it.

1,Yeah it happened when I was working at a Pizza hut.  After that I went back to school so I didn't have to work in such places anymore.

1,How old are your  children?
1,She is terrible. Thats not nice at all.
1,I believe dogs can understand what you tell them_comma_ they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!
1,That is great. I stress myself out over things and I think by doing that it makes things worse.
1,I get to go to the zoo this afternoon.

1,Yes_comma_ it turned out well and little Wolfie is happy too.
1,It is. The hospital was negligent. 
1,Oh nice_comma_ have you met them yet?
1,I understand. Those thing happened from time to time.
1,My mom decided to give me a precious family heirloom this past Christmas. It was quite unexpected!
1,Well_comma_ we'll see. I'm generally pretty healthy and haven't been to the doctor in like over 6 years for anything other than the flu. So_comma_ hopefully my immune system will keep it at bay. But it was just it's something so simple and avoidable_comma_ and they didn't do it. I guess I should feel more empathy for them though_comma_ since they're sick.

1,I'm glad you had such a fun time.
1,Understandable_comma_ it must have been very unexpected!
1,Yeah me too. They are unbelievable. 
1,I don't know_comma_ I felt like I tried pretty hard and poured my heart into my project and still didn't come close. It kind of feels unfair. Maybe she's juts naturally better than I am.
1,I cannot wait for the new super smash bros game_comma_ it looks amazing!
1,I give up on trying to figure out most women! I compliment her and give her my undivided attention and she pulls away. But the minute I start being unattached and talking to another lady she clings on desperately for my attention it drives me nuts hahaha

1,I'm happy for you that this new manager is better. It just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable.
1,Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence?

1,It is a chevy malibu. What a great feeling
1,I got cut off in traffic the other day I almost wrecked. It ticked me off.

1,I'm sure with time the pain will pass. Try to stay positive!
1,That's good to hear! What sort of things has he changed or started doing?
1,I ate an entire pepperoni pizza yesterday. That is not a part of my diet.
1,Naw_comma_ he's somewhat lazy like myself when I was a young lad_comma_ but still_comma_ it was rather disappointing.

1,Was she honest about it or did you find out the hard way?
1,Well I'm glad you weren't hurt.
1,It was! I was so happy. I thought I would lose him forever.
1,Do you plan on arguing to him about it?
1,Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. 
1,Yeah_comma_ its times like that make me who I am today I feel like
1,That has to be disappointing. Can you change your plans?
1,i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery
1,I have the best dentist.
1,I got a thank you note from the VP of applications at my company.

1,I am so irritated it took so long.
1,Maybe you will win something else!
1,1 month of training. And it would have been if I actually finished it. I had to stop halfway through
1,I know what you mean. All the people seem to be the same types - fame hungry narcissists

1,I just have to suck it up even though I was disgusted and had to hold my nose the entire time!
1,My thermostat is out of control. Feels like winter here.

1,Do you have the same relationship with your Dad?
1,Rainy days are boring_comma_ but I do like the sound of them. It's calming in a way
1,Sadly thats true. I just hope that person doesn't endanger others.
1,Yeah now I have to cancel all my credit cards_comma_ it's such a hassle
1,I can't believe I was the only one to think to bring Smores supplies on our camping trip!

1,I am very irritated with people who want to make everyone else miserable when they are.
1,I didn't do anything wrong. I am so upset it happened.

1,That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it_comma_ ultimately.

1,It's nice to have a place of your own. I remember the excitement I felt when I bought my house.
1,Do you think you'll be next ?
1,Someone spread rumor about my hubby.
1,I work 24 hour shifts and have been working so much lately. I have two beach trips coming up in September and I can't wait!
1,I lost my favorite shoe today!
1,That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. 
1,Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.
1,Oh yea_comma_ that movie was one of my favorites when I was a child
1,I know right. The anticipation is killing me
1,Oh really? How did that make you feel_comma_ honestly?
1,Oh man! That's some Jerry Springer level drama. What happened? Did you tell him/
1,That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see?
1,I know exactly what you mean. Achievement and productivity then rest and relaxation provide a certain level of contentment.
1,I bet your audience missed out!

1,Yeah_comma_ you have a point. Thanks. I know they say everything in moderation though_comma_ so I try to be sensible. But then I get mad at someone or something at work and it makes me just want to grab like three packs of M&M's
1,I have to take my kids to parks outside of our neighborhood.
1,I'm so mad at my neighbor! He blasts his tv outside on his patio all night long.
1,I just shooed him off.  They're a little scary but_comma_ they're not typically to agressive.

1,He had just been busy with life. But he was at my house when I got home for work.

1,It wasn't mine. I had no idea who's it was. It wasn't hurt though_comma_ it sprinted away as soon as it landed.

1,IT was literally the next day :|
1,Yeah she is doing so good. It's her 3rd year playing and she loves it.
1,No yet. But I am planning to visit him and marry him. It sounds crazy_comma_ I know. But I am in love.
1,The anniversary of my father's death recently passed. I'm still adjusting to things without him.
1,It was_comma_ but honestly it was the best thing for my family.  I had just told them that I was pregnant with my 2nd child and I truly think they did not want to share me with the family I was creating.
1,I got bar-b-que from a place a few weeks ago and it literally tasted like the got it out of a dumpster. 
1,Thank you! I wanted him to know he is cared about and that I wanted him to feel better. I would want the same done for me!
1,I felt bad when I skipped work when I was not sick. I just lied about it

1,Yes_comma_ I have this feeling of excitement for his new adventure_comma_ but also worry. And I'm just going to miss him so much_comma_ he's a wonderful kid.
1,They can not curt you. They are tiny and powerless.

1,It's always good to be prepared.
1,I'm a teacher.  School starts back for me in two weeks.
1,I really wanted to go with my family on vacation but I couldnt go and it sucks. 
1,i always remember spending time with my grandparents when i watch old western movies

1,Oh wow_comma_ that's great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs.
1,Lovely- how old is he?
1,I think we're going to have a grad party on the weekend.
1,work kept piling up and couldnt leave
1,Got a huge delivery. Not even sure I can get it through the door.

1,what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere?
1,Yeah_comma_ it is very special to a lot of people_comma_ blood is thicker than water
1,I'm feeling pretty nervous to return to Florida. I don't know if I have many options if I go back_comma_ or if it will turn out well or not.
1,I understand. Does the grocery store have outside some camera?
1,Yes I had to slam on my breaks but I'm fine_comma_ it's quite annoying I don't know why people do it.
1,I do not like them cause they are always slimy.
1,Well they do like to hang out in corners. I would try not to worry too much. They are more interested in bugs.
1,How do you think you did on it?
1,that is true_comma_ still hurts a lot
1,That's really sweet. Is there any member of your family you are particularly close with?
1,cost me about 14k crazyness!

1,i was ready for that test yesterday
1,How did you end up doing?

1,That sound like a lot of fun! Will it be your first time?
1,I am feeling very spooked at the moment.
1,Well_comma_ I haven't practiced enough and I need to refine my notes I think

1,today was a great day. my nephew was born

1,Oh my_comma_ what movie was it?!
1,I have my final math test tomorrow.
1,Did you ever move out?
1,Weekends are beautiful if you don't work on them and have nothing to do!
1,Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone
1,I know they have to grow up and all but can't they stay littles for a little bit longer?
1,My favorite day of the week has been Wednesdays for the last few years.

1,You must feel so terrible. Are you going to stay with her?
1,I never took my dog to doggie school and I regretted it. She could have done with some more discipline. 
1,I have been collecting supplies for this hurricane season. I think I am ready for anything that comes our way!

0,We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . 
0,"The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . "
0,Well . I hope there won't be such things . 
0,I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods .

0,Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by them . 
0,This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 
0,I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . 
0,Don't worry . These dates are only targets . 
0,Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
0,"I don ' t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? "
0,"Not sure yet . How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ' t look good . "
1,What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ' s brand new ! 
0,"Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . "
0,Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
0,"I ' m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . "
1,What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
0,May I use your phone ? 
0,Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
0,Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .

1,"Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute . Here you are . "
1,"Thanks . Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here . Would you mind checking , please ? "
1,"Of course not . Let me check . Oh , you seem to be correct . "
0,How about taxes service charge ? 
0,Only ten percent of taxes included in the bill . 
0,"Then 100 US dollars covers everything , doesn't it ?"
1,"This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . "
0,"Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . "
0,"Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . "
0,Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars . 
0,"Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing . "
0,How are you doing today ? 
0,What can I help you with ? 
0,Do I have any fees to pay ? 
0,"As a matter of fact , you do . "
0,Will you be paying some of that off today ? 
0,I want to pay all of it off today . 
0,How will you be paying ?

0,Hello . Is there a package tour to Beijing ? 
0,"Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places . "
0,Does the tour have a Chinese-speaking guide ? 
0,What is the cost of the tour ? 
0,It's a bit expensive . Can you tell me the schedule ? 
0,"Yes , I will introduce the itinerary in detail . "
0,"Well , do you have any experience in guiding ? "
0,"Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . "
0,What places of interest did you show them ? 
0,"Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . "
0,What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . 
0,"Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . "
0,"We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . "
0,"What is the temperature today , do you know ? "
0,"About freezing point , I think . But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero ."
0,"Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat . "
0,It is considerate of your wife . 
0,"Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ? "
0,"Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . "
0,Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time . 
0,do you think this music is warm matched ? 
0,it bring me back to some of my childhood memories . 
1,"yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting . "
1,"of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance . "
1,it is full of energy . 
1,this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying . 
0,Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
0,All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . 
0,Have you received any other honors ? 
0,Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 .
0,Do you have anything published ? 
0,Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Youth Writer's Collection . 
0,"hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . "
0,"yes , you sent them to New York , right ? "
0,that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs . 
0,what did you in mind ? 
0,"well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . "
0,we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
0,posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
0,"yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . "
0,how much do they cost ? 
0,the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
0,"yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . "
0,"I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . "
0,are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift . 
0,"yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . "

0,"Well , may I leave a message ? "
0,Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
0,Ok . Does he know your number ? 
0,I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .

0,"Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory . "
0,"I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash . "
0,Don't worry about it . It ' s on me . 
1,"In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . "
0,"I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . "
0,Are you on the up and up ? 
0,"Definitely . you know , I'm into serious sport in a big way . "
0,"If you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . "
0,"come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . "
0,"Fat chance , I'm too scared of bungee jumping . "
0,"No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . "
0,What did that have to do with me ? I'm not the self-seeker like you . 
0,I can teach you how . 
0,"I had a sneaking suspicion about you , Eric , I think you've lost it . "
0,"No , not really , but I think I have lost my wallet . Where can it be ? "
0,Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ' t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! 
0,"Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . "
1,"Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! "
0,Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
1,"Don ' t you worry , I ' ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ' s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! "
1,"Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! "
0,Let's have lunch together today . 
0,I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? 
0,I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . 
0,What about cheese cake or apple pie ? 
0,Maybe I want an apple pie . 
0,How often are stockholders meetings held ? 
0,"Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . "
0,What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... 
0,"You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . "
0,"So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? "
0,"Unless they're united , very little ... "
0,May I take your order now ? 
0,"Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . "
0,Do you want some salad dressing ? 
0,"Yes , what kind do you have ? "
0,"We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese . "
0,I think French will be fine . 
0,I'm going to the Golden hotel . 
1,Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10
0,"Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please ."
1,"Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please ."
0,"Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? "
0,"Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . "
0,"Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . "
0,Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
0,What about the outer packing ? 
0,"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton ."
0,Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
0,I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . 
0,"The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . "
0,"Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . "
0,"No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . "
0,"Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . "
0,Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . 
0,"Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . "
0,"But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . "
0,"If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . "
0,"I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . "
0,I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . 
0,"We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . "

1,"Whoa , that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . "
1,"All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! "
1,"Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . "
1,Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
1,It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 
1,"Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! "
0,"Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave . "

0,"Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . "
0,We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . 
1,"Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . "
0,"10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country ."

It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . "
0,"But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . "

0,"No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . "
0,"Peter , take off your pajamas . "
0,What should I wear today ? 
0,"It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket . "

0,I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! 
0,Gee ! You are really strong-willed .

1,Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? 
0,How many stops are there ? 
0,Two stops after this one . 
0,Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
0,"By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?"
0,"No , a No . 50 will take you right there ."
0,"Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? "
0,Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton .
0,"But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . "
0,"I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . "
0,OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . 
0,Can I get you something to drink ?

0,What should I drink then ? 
0,You should really drink water . 
0,It's a lot better than soda . 
0,Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
0,Are they window seats or aisle seats ? 
0,"Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . "
0,Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
0,That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
0,Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
0,"I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . "
0,Don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
0,Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
0,"Oh , you have too wild of an imagination . "
0,Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ?

0,"Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . "
0,"Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . "
0,You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . 
0,"Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . "
0,"So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? "
0,"Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . "
0,"For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops ."
0,"Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . "
0,I'm looking for a pair of shoes . 
0,What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
0,I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?
1,"Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive . "
0,"It's on the south wall of the store , in aisle A . "
0,Is there any produce on sale ? 
0,"I don't know . The produce person can tell you , though . "
0,"That'll be eight dollars , please . "
0,Here's ten . Keep the change . 
0,"Hi , Mr . Smith . I ' m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? "
0,I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
0,"Yes , well you haven ' t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . "
0,"I know . I figure as long as there ' s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? "
0,"Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . "
0,"Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? "
0,"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . "
0,"I ' Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ' t seem to kick the habit . "
0,"Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ' ll give you more information before you leave . "
0,"Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? "

1,The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
1,"Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks . "

1,"Yes , everything has been well designed . "

0,Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ?

0,"I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better . "
0,"OK , the postage is 275 yuan ."
0,"This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day . "
0,Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? 
0,"I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ' re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . "

0,"I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing .

0,"Well , I just want to enjoy what I ' m doing it ' s the most important thing to me . "
0,"Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . "
0,Do you want to get a promotion ? 
0,Where would you like to be in 5 years ?
0,"In five years , I ' d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . "
0,How do you plan to accomplish this ? 
0,By doing whatever is necessary . 
0,What are in this folder ? 
0,They are reports of our company . 
0,"No , they are filed according to dates . "
0,"Can you find last month ' s report for me , please ? "
0,"No problem , here you are . "
0,"Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin ."

1,"And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ' Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ' s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . "
0,"I know , I ' m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ' t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ' t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ' t have missed my deadline . "
1,"Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ' re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . "
0,"No , I ' m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ' t gone down . And you know , with everything I ' Ve got going on now , I can ' t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ' Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... "
1,"I ' m not going to accept this excuse . You ' re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ' Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ' re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! "
1,I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
0,May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? 
0,"You see , there is a run at the neck . "
0,"Oh , sorry . But do you want to change it for another one ? "
0,Welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ?

0,I didn ' t have any change . 
0,Tell me why you didn ' t come to see me tonight then . 
0,I don ' t like all your questions . That ' s why .

0,"oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? "
0,"it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . "
0,"she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? "
0,I have a little white cat . 
1,"Oh , a cat ? Come on . "
0,"yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . "
0,"but I think they're dull , aren't they ? "
0,not at all . They're quiet most of the time . But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
0,"well , cats are certainly more independent . "
0,"absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . "
1,"oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? "
0,yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
1,now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
0,"Hello , housekeeping . Is there anything I can do for you ? "

0,We charge $ 5 for a barrel .
0,"OK , here are the clothes . "

0,My company wants to become involved in your Comprehensive Credit Granting . We are a very young company and I'm not at all sure if we meet your credit requirements . 
0,"It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you . "
1,That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help . 
0,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
0,"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . "
1,It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
0,"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? "
1,"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! "
0,"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . "
0,"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . "
1,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
1,"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . "
0,"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? "
1,"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! "
0,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
0,I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
0,"Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? "
0,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
0,"Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . "
0,I heard you will be going on a business trip . 
0,"Yes , I must go to Shanghai to attend a meeting about our plan . "
0,How long will you be away ? 
0,Who will take your place ? 
0,Harry . He has been assisting me on the plan . 
0,Good choice . He is competent for the position . 
0,"Yes , he is familiar with the plan . "
0,"Mom , give me a glass of orange juice . "
0,What the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ? 
0,"Oh , sorry mom , i forgot.please give me a glass of orange juice . "
1,"Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . "
0,"Amy , you forgot another magic word . "
1,"Oh , sorry again , thank you mom . "
0,You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? 
0,"To be honest , I haven't really done much research . "
0,"I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir . "
0,"Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . "
0,"Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . "

0,"20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery ."

0,Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . 
0,"Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? "
0,All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you .

0,"Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... "
0,"I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . "
0,"Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . "
0,"Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . "

0,Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . 
1,I wish my parents were a little more lenient . 
0,I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . 
0,You like going to bed early ? 
0,I don't like being too tired the next day . 
1,"Well , I still hate having a curfew . "
0,"If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . "
0,"Hi , excuse me sir ? I ' m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ' Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ' t provide any support anymore . "
0,"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ' Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ' re looking for something a little more practical , we ' Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . "

0,Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
0,"She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? "
0,"When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . "
0,"You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? "
1,It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
0,I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
0,"On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space . She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . "
0,That's true . I guess we ' ll have to keep looking for a manager then . 
0,"Don't worry , we ' ll find someone eventually ! "
0,"Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? "
0,"Yes , you get off at the square . "

0,I didn ' t commit the crime . 
0,Do you know who did ? 
0,"If I tell you who did , will you release me ? "

0,"When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? "

0,is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 
0,"yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards ."

0,"they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . "

0,"Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . "
0,I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? 
0,"It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB ."
0,"So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . "
0,"I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . "
0,"That is good , it should speed things up nicely . "
0,Do you have any other questions ? 
0,I want to know about fees . 
0,You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft . 
0,How much is the fee ? 
0,You'll have to pay $ 25 every time you overdraft .
0,That ' s a small fee ? 
0,It should stop you from overdrafting . 
0,"You would think it would , but it most likely won ' t . "
0,Can I help you with anything else ? 
0,That ' s it for today . Thank you . 
0,May I take the liberty to introduce myself to you ? My name is Dick Brown . I am the sales manager of our company .

0,Do you have any other questions ? 
0,"Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? "
0,Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company .

0,"You look pale , Paul . What's wrong ? "
0,I'm sorry to hear that . Anything I can do for you ? 
0,"No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . "
0,Is there any cable for the Internet ? 
0,How much do I need to pay for it ? 
0,Is there a mailbox in the apartment ? 
0,Yes . Each apartment has one . 
0,Are there any parking lots for the tenants ? 
0,Yes . But you need to pay $ 60 for it each month .

0,Does this hotel have a pool ? 
0,"I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations . "
0,I'm not sure I understand . 
0,"Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . "
0,Cool . What will they think of next ? How much are they ? 
0,"Sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations . "
0,Excellent ! Now what are the hours ?

0,I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours . 
0,Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
0,Yes . I once worked in a small stock exchange . My work is very simple . 
0,"No , I thought it too dull . Also I didn't think it was challenging enough . "

0,"What's the best time to call you , then ? "

0,I see . Do you have any ideas so far ? 
0,Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ? 
0,"Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ? "
0,About 158cm . He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters .
0,I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers . 
0,I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles . 
0,How about this one then ? 
0,"The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while . "
0,"Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? "
0,Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . 
0,Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . 
0,"Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . "
0,Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? 
0,Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . 
0,"Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? "
0,You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . 
0,I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? 
0,There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . 
0,"Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . "
0,It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? 
0,I'll take care of the order . 
0,"OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ?"
0,Don't forget about the dessert .

0,Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
1,Really ? Where did you hear that ? 
0,"I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? "
0,"I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . "
0,"No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . "
0,That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
0,Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
0,"Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . "
1,"No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . "
1,"Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . "
0,How do I make a good impression in the interview ? 
0,"You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . "
0,Don ' t boast and don ' t be modest . 
0,What do you mean by this ? You can ' t do the two things at the same time . 
0,Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ' re competent . Don ' t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ' re talking big . 
0,"Try to be natural , alert and interested . "
1,You ' Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . 
1,My pleasure . Good luck to you . 
0,Jason . There ' s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . 
0,What ' s wrong ? I thought everything was set . 
0,"Well , it was . But the contractor ' s just told me he ' s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned . "
0,Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ' s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . 
0,How were you getting along with your studies ? 
0,Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester . 
0,"In addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ? "
0,"Yes , I had taken finance courses in a training school . Compound talents are needed in the society and I must study continually to keep abreast with the times . "
0,"Excuse me , what's the charge for a picture ? "
0,$ 1 . You can get your photos instantly .
1,That's great . Give me the landscape of the Triumphal for the background . 
0,No problem . Say ' cheese ' . That's good . Please wait a moment . 
0,What can I do for you today ? 
0,Can I sign up for some classes today ? 
0,I would like to take a driver's course . 
0,Would you like to make an appointment ? 
0,Why do I need an appointment ? 
0,You need to sign the paperwork . 
0,Can I do that right now ? 
0,When can you come in ? 
0,How about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning ?
0,I'll schedule you for then . 
1,Thanks for all your help . 
1,The tea smells good . What tea is it ? 
0,It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . 
0,What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? 
0,You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . 
0,They must have some special methods to do this during the process . 
0,Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . 
0,"Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? "
0,Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . 
0,What's the advantage about tea ? 
0,"There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . "
0,Does that mean the stronger the better ? 
0,No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . 
0,Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? 
0,It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . 
1,"It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . "
0,"Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? "
0,Will you be checking any bags today . 
0,"Yes , I ' d like to check three pieces . "
0,"I ' m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . "
1,"What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd ! "
0,"I am sorry , sir , there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . "
1,"Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . "
0,Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 
1,That ' s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
0,"Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . "
0,"Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . "
0,That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . 
0,"Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . "
0,"These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing "
0,"Oh , the packing looks very nice . "
0,The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . 
0,"Good , what about the export packing ? "
0,"Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case ."
0,"Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms ."
0,"You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . "
0,"I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? "
0,"Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . "
0,"Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . "
0,All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . 
0,Can you do me a favor ? 
0,"Can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? Nature's calling . "
1,Sure . Will you be long ? 
0,"No , I just want to use the bathroom . "
0,Go ahead . It will be safe with me . 
0,Did you ever get your bus pass ? 
0,I don't think I'm going to get one . 
0,"It's just a waste of cash , man ! "

0,That sounds like a good deal . 
0,"Yeah , So , are you going to buy one ? "

0,I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet . 
0,"You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more . "
0,How much more would it cost to upgrade ? 
0,"It could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard ."
0,Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ?

0,Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed . 
0,Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service .

0,I ' m sorry . I ' ll arrange a non-smoking room for you right away . The doorman is going to help you with your luggage . I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
0,I wish to order 100 sets of hifi . Do you have this service ?
0,Sony or some other brands ? 
0,Sony please . Do you have extra charge for delivery ? 
0,May I know who's calling ? 
1,"Glad to hear your voice , David . "
0,Yes . What can I do for you ? 
0,I want to inform you of the interview . 
0,What ? I can barely hear you because your veiled voice ? 
0,I said I am informing you of the interview . 
0,The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . 
0,How does she cook the shrimp ? 
0,She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . 
0,"I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . "
0,My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . 
0,It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . 
1,Really ? I really want to have a try ! 
1,Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! 
1,That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . 
0,"Can you believe this ? I locked my keys in the car , and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . "
0,"So , what are you going to do ? "
0,"I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? "
1,"I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . "
0,"Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there . "
0,"Oh , and Andy ? Do you have a quarter for the phone ? My wallet's in the car . "
0,Here you go . Anything else ? 
1,"No , that's it . Thanks . I really appreciate it . "
0,Which kind would you like ? We have five different varieties of facials . 
0,"Well , since it's summer , and I had looked that you had quite a bit sun , I'll recommend our summer special , it's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin . "

0,I stayed at Bob's last night . 
0,I was worried where you were . 
0,I guess I should have told you . 
0,It ' s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
0,Don ' t touch that thermostat ! You don ' t pay the bills around here ! 
1,"Dad ! Are you serious ? What ' s the point of having central heating if we can ' t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! "
1,Put on a sweater ! I ' m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ' s a bit chilly . 
1,Dad ! I ' m gonna catch a cold ! 
0,"When I was your age , my parents didn ' t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! "
0,I'd like to send this to Chicago . 
0,Air mail or surface mail ? 
0,Please put it on the Scale there . Seventy five cents . 
0,"Make it special delivery , please . "
1,"Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you . "
0,Which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ? 
0,"My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? "
0,"I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . "
0,"Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company ."
1,"Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! "
0,"Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . "
0,The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
0,That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ? 
0,The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
0,"I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . "
0,"Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . "
0,"Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . "
0,I have a question about my cable . 
0,I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week . 
0,Right now the cable isn't working . 
0,Could you tell me when it will be back on ? 
0,The cable should be running again in a couple of days . 
0,"In the meantime , do I still have to pay for the cable ? "
0,We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience . 
0,Does that mean I won't have to pay for it ? 
0,It'll be free until it comes back on . 
1,"Thanks , I appreciate your help . "
1,Thank you for all your patience . 
0,"I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . "
0,"Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . "
0,"Actually , it is my mother ' s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ' Ve got to be there , right ? "
0,"Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ' t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . "
0,I'm sorry . He's not here right now . 
0,What time will he be back ? 
0,Yes . May I ask who's calling ? 
0,"This is his friend , Greg . "
0,Okay . I'll tell him you called . 
0,"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . "
0,"Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . "
0,How long does it take to get there ? 
0,"About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . "
0,"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! "
0,"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . "
0,Great ! I ' ll take it . 
0,Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
1,I understand . Thank you very much ! 
0,"Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? "
0,"Yes , ma ' am . How may I help you ? "
0,I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 
0,"Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ' am ."
0,How big is this parking lot in our community ? 
0,It has fifty parking spaces . 
0,So you guys should be always busy . 
0,I bet it is always full of cars . 
0,"Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . "
0,We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . 
0,What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? 
0,I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . 
0,How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? 
0,"That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . "
1,Ouch ! The water's too hot ! 
0,"Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . "
0,"I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat . "
1,Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 
0,"That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? "
0,I'd like to help pitch in with dinner . 
0,No . I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
0,"I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . "
0,"OK ... Now how can I help , hon ? "
0,"Hmm , let me see ... Boil some water . "
0,Easy . I could do that with my eyes closed . ( after a while ) Done . 
0,"Not bad . Okay , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . "
0,How many potatoes do you need ? 
0,Three . And bring four bell peppers . 
0,Gotcha ... OK . Here they are . 
0,"Now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers . "
0,"Dad , how do you say this word ? "
0,What does this word mean ? 
0,Look it up in the dictionary . 
0,"Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . "
0,"No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . "
1,Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you . 
1,"Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time . "
1,I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity ! 
1,It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 
1,"Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off . "
1,"You know , art is something I've always been interested in ... "
0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? "
1,Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 
0,"Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . "
0,"I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . "
0,So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? 
0,Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 
0,"I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion "
1,"Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . "
0,"Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company . "
0,I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person . 
0,We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . 
0,"Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . "
0,Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? 
0,I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . 
0,"Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . "
0,"Yes , would you please call me a taxi first ? "
0,No problem . How would you like to pay ? 
0,Credit card please . Here you are . 
0,How do you want to advertise the opening ? 
0,"I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . "
0,All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . 
0,OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . 
0,And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . 
0,"Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . "
0,"Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . "

0,Don't worry . There are so many people . We will join the touring party . 
0,Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
0,"Oh , no . You should take the No . 14 tram ."
0,Where can I take it ? 
0,Two blocks down the street . 
0,"Excuse me , could you help me ? "
0,"Yes , what seems to be the problem ? "
0,Well . I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ? 
1,I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ? 
0,I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store . 
0,Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ? 
0,In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . 
1,"Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ' Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . "
0,Then what shall I do ? 
0,"You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up . "
0,You are right . Do you have a pen ? 
0,"Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . "
0,Greetings should never be ignored in the interview . 
0,Sure . It is helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere . 
0,Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression 
0,But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes . 
0,"In the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile . "
0,"In the interview , use polite words , such as ' Thank you ' , or ' Please ' . "
0,That's right . Details can mean succeed or fail . 
0,When talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . 
0,"At the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say Goode . "
0,"Whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor . "
0,Only in this way can you leave a good impression on the interviewer . 
0,"In short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview . "
0,Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? 
0,I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . 
0,He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . 
0,"Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . "
0,How do you propose to help him understand that ? 
0,"Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . "
0,I guess we could go visit once in a while too . 
0,Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . 
0,Does it look too big ? 
0,It looks like it was made just for you . 
1,"Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . "

0,"good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . "
0,the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
0,oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
0,she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
0,is there someone else I can talk to ? 
0,she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
0,any time after 2 pm today would be good for me .
0,Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ?
0,I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
0,I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ?
0,"ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then ."

0,"You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ?"
0,"Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . "
0,"Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . "

0,How often must I take it ? 
0,Three times a day after meals . 
0,We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . 
0,How much would you like ? 
0,"10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity ."
0,"A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time ."
0,The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business .
0,"Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % ."
0,I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . 
0,"Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . "
0,No . We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes . Now it's your turn to do them .

0,"There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir . "
0,I stopped counting at nine . 
0,"Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors . "
1,Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . 
0,"I apologize , sir . Just a second , while I transfer you to my supervisor . "
0,Can you help me please ? 
0,Do you know if there is Japanese restaurant near the hotel ? 
0,Actually there ' s one on the same street as this hotel .

0,I haven ' t been able to get a good night ' s sleep lately . I ' m exhausted !

0,I go to bed when I finish my work . 
0,Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? 
1,I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . 
0,You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . 
0,Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . 
0,"Liz , you were supposed to have had those contracts typed up by now . "
0,I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that . 
0,"No , Liz . I asked you specifically . Don ' t you remember ? "
1,"I ' m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ' t remember that . "
0,"Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? "
0,"We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . "
0,"What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . "
0,"No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . "
0,What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? 
0,We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . 
0,"You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? "
0,We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . 
0,"I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . "
0,You seem to be in a hurry . 
0,Yes . I ' Ve got a meeting in a minute .

0,"Hello , who is speaking , please ? "
0,"Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency . I have made the plane reservations for you . "
0,"Oh , good . Let me get a pencil and take down the information . Well , go ahead , please . "
0,"Okay . You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines , flight number 222 ."
0,What time does it leave ? 
0,It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 .
0,"You want to fly first class . Is that correct , Mr . Stern ? "
0,"Well , I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats . Your seat numbers are 8A , 8B and 8C ."
0,"Those are in the non-smoking section , aren't they ? "
0,"Yes , they are . I have charged the tickets to your credit card . They are 630 dollars each , so It is 1890 dollars for all three ."
0,"Fine , thank you very much . "
0,One more thing . Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with ? 
0,"Sure . They are my kids , Alex and Kathy Stern . "
0,All right . You're all set . Have a nice flight . 
0,It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . 
0,How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 
0,"I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . "
0,"It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . "
0,"I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? "
0,"Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . "
0,"Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . "
0,"It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? "
0,"We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . "
0,"I ' m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ' s come up . "
0,You mean for this afternoon ' s meeting ? 
0,"That ' s right I ' m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ' s Symposium in his place . I ' m leaving today , and I won ' t be back until a week from Friday . "
0,"That ' s quite a while . Let ' s make it the week after you get back , then . "
0,"That will be great . So it ' s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ' m really sorry to do this to you . "
0,"No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . "
0,Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
1,Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
0,A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan .
0,"If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . "
0,Really ? I ' ll take it then . 
0,"I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . "
1,"With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? "
0,"My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . "
0,Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 
0,Does that make any difference ? 
0,"Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . "
0,"A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . "
0,I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . 
0,Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? 
0,It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . 
0,It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? 
0,"Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . "
0,"Would you like to meet at the real estate office , or should I pick you up at home ? "
0,"If you could pick me up at home , that would be great . "
0,We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see . 
0,"That might be a little too much , but we ' ll see how it goes . "
0,I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times . 
0,"Mrs . Lee , I ' Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . "
0,Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ' re always welcome here . 
1,Thank you . You ' Ve been so nice to me . 
0,Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? 
1,"No , thanks . You ' Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . "
1,Don ' t mention it . I ' Ve really enjoyed your company . 
0,Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . 
0,"Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . "
0,"Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . "
0,For wood or for metal ? 
0,"For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? "
0,"Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? "
0,"Yes , quite free until noon . "
0,"Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . "
1,Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . 
0,"Take your time , sir . I can wait . "
0,The radio said it's OK on this road . 
1,We have too many cars ! 
0,I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed . 
0,"OK , do you want us to use starch ? "
0,"Yes , heavy starch in the collar please . "
0,"Yeah , sir . Your shirt will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ? "
0,I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
0,Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
0,We'll remain open from 9 a . m . till 8 p . m .
0,"Here's your laundry ticket , sir . "
0,Do you have a cold ? 
0,No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
0,"Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? "
0,"I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . "
0,I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
0,Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
0,Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
0,"Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out . Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . "
0,Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
0,I'm not sure yet . Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
0,It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside . Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
1,"Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup . Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . "
1,"Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . "
0,"Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . "
0,"Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . "
0,"I don't have any more cash , and I have to get on another bus to get home . "
0,Why don't you have any more money ? 
0,"I wanted some chips at lunch today , so I spent it . "
0,That was a bright idea . 
0,I know . Do you have some change I can borrow ? 
0,You know what ? I don't have any change for you . 
0,I need to get home . 
0,Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ? 
0,I don't have money for a transfer . 
0,You know ? Go ask for a transfer . They're free . 
1,Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know . 
0,We're going to have to postpone the meeting . 
0,Mr . Chen can't make it today . 
0,Can you recognize Mike's father in the crowd ? 
0,"Yes , he's holding a bunch of books . "
0,Let's run up and give him a hand . 
0,Do you know what you're going to do this weekend ? 
0,I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine . What about you ? 
0,Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ? 
0,Do you know what movie you're going to watch ? 
0,"I don't know , but was there a certain movie you wanted to see ? "
0,None that I can think of . 
0,"Well , would you like to go ? "
0,"Thank you for inviting me , but I think I'll pass . "
0,All right . Another time then . 
0,What is this ? I didn't order that . 
1,I ' m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . 
0,I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . 
1,I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . 
0,"Pardon me , Miss . But didn't you order chicken soup ? "
0,"Oh , Is that what this is ? "
0,"I believe so . But if it really bothers you , I'll replace it for you . "
0,"No , don't replace it . Give a refund . "
1,Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead . 
1,"Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . "
1,I hope you enjoy your dinner . 
0,How are you doing today ? 
0,What can I do for you ? 
0,I would like to cancel a check . 
0,I wrote the check out for too much . 
0,How much did you write it out for ? 
0,I wrote it out for $ 150 .
0,How much was it supposed to be ? 
0,It was supposed to be for $ 100 .
0,I ' ll cancel that check for you . 
1,I really appreciate your help . 
1,It's nice of you to see me off . 
1,It's my pleasure . Hope you ' ll visit Beijing more often . 
1,"OK . I hope you have a good trip . Thanks ever so much for your cooperation , Mr . Simpson . Give my best wishes to Mr . Green . "

0,I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 
0,how can I help you ? 
0,I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend .

0,how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . 
0,she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
0,how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 
0,no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
0,I know what she would like---some whitening cream . 
0,"no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . "

0,What kind of room do you have in mind ?

0,Well take your time . There are so many things to sell .

0,Excuse me . I'm looking for Bluemingdails . Could you tell me how to get there ? 
0,"Sure . It's very close actually . You go straight down this road . Then you turn left , at the next junction . "
0,Left the next junction . Ok . 
0,"Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . You see it as you turn left.Seriously , You can't miss it . It ' s enormous . "
0,May I have a magazine or something ?

0,"Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order . "
0,Are you sure you want to go ? 
0,To the restroom ? I have no choice . 
0,"Bell Computers Limited , can I help you ? "
0,"Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . "
0,"Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? "
0,"Yes , can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? My name's Mary , and I'm calling from Happy Travel . My number is 123 456 789 ."

0,"Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! "
0,"I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . "
0,"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . "
0,I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
0,"Say , what's you favorite sport ? "
0,"Mmmm ... , it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess like skating better . "

0,I have to write you a ticket . 
0,Can't you give me a warning ? 
0,I'm not going to be able to do that . 
0,How much will the fine be ? 
0,You'll find that out on your court date .

0,how often do you usually cook ? 
0,I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week .

0,"I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . "
0,what kind of dishes do you usually make ? 
0,"I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . "

0,We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ' s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . 
1,"That sounds good , but I don ' t want this house to get away from me . "
0,"The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . "
0,When will we know if they accept the offer ? 
0,The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . 
0,Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? 
0,"You are already pre-qualified for your loan , so you are in good shape . "
0,Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies .

0,How do you usually spend your time after work ? 
0,I prefer to read novels with a cup of tea . 
0,What kind of books interests you most ? 
0,You seem to be a man of imagination and logic . 
0,"To some extent , I regard books as my good companion . "
0,"If so , you can benefit a lot from them . "
0,"Actually , I was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ? "
0,"Well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . "
0,"I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? "
0,"Oh , I am sorry . I misunderstood . Well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . What do you say ?"
0,That sounds perfect for us . 
0,Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ?

0,"Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? "
0,"Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . "
1,His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? 
0,"Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . "
1,"Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . "
0,Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . 
0,"OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . "
0,"Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . "
0,"I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? "
0,Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . 
0,Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? 
0,"Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . "
0,"Just like the pattern dragon , right ? "

0,Shall I come in and collect it ? 
0,"Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . "
0,"Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . "
0,"As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . "
0,"I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks ."
0,What qualifications should a reporter have ? 
0,"As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others . "
0,"Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper . "
0,I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly . 
0,"Hi , good morning , Miss ? what can I help you with ? "
0,Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan . 
0,"OK , please put it on this scale . Airmail or by sea ? "
0,How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ? 
0,That's too long . How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ? 
0,Then how much is that by airmail ? 
0,"Let me see . It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax ."
0,That's a little bit expensive . 
0,"Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea . "
0,I guess I have to send it by airmail . 
0,"Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ? "
0,"Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space . "

0,"What is that problem , sir ? "
0,There are cockroaches in my room . 
0,"Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ? "
0,"I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one . "
0,"Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel . "
1,You dare to doubt me ? 
0,"I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . "
1,"Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here . "
0,Why not ? It's my parking space . 
1,"Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !"
0,But I saw a red car always parking here before . 
0,"Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red . "
0,Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left . 
0,Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .

0,So what about the tennis racket ? 
1,Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! 
0,How much did that end up costing you ? 
0,Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it ! 
1,"Hey , two for one . That's a super deal . "
0,"I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . "
0,There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? 
0,"Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . "
0,I'll call him and tell him you're here . 
0,Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ? 
0,OK . I'll have him come up to get you . 
0,"Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ? "
0,"Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything . "
0,"Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few . "
0,"So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? "

0,I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long . 
0,"Sir , the curb here is not for parking . "
0,"But I didn't see the sign , Ma ' am . "
0,"There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it . "
1,"I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault ."
0,Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
0,"Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . "
0,Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
0,I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
0,It's the most important thing to me . 
0,"If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? "
0,That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . 
0,Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . 
0,"I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . "
0,What is your long-range objective ? 
0,I haven't thought it over at all . 
0,What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? 
0,I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . 
0,I'd like to open a current account . 
0,"Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please . "
0,Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account . 
0,"Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . "
0,"It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . "
0,I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? 
0,"So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? "
0,It'll be a national campaign starting next week . 
0,What style will the ads be ? 
0,"I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . "
0,Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? 
0,I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? 
0,That's fine . You must try this dish . 
0,Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
0,It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . 
0,Sure . It's a most popular dish . 
0,"I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . "
0,We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? 
0,What kind do you have ? 
0,We have French and Thousand Island . 
0,"Where will you go , sir ? "
0,"OK , it's not far from here . "
0,"I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ? "
0,"Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are . "
0,How much should I pay you ? 
0,The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
0,"Here's 20 yuan , keep the change ."
0,Mr . Johnson ' s office . Cindy speaking . 
0,"Hi , Cindy . It ' s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ? "
0,"No , I ' m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ' s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? "
0,"Yeah , that ' ll be great . I ' m on extension 4283 ."
0,"Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . "
0,"So , what do we do now ? "
0,This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . 
0,"Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . "
0,"Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . "
0,Can I pay you by check ? 
0,Sure . A check will be fine . 
0,Is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
0,Can I sign the lease right now ? 
0,Good morning ! What can I do for you ? 
0,I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? 
0,"With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey . "
0,How much does a six-day tour by train cost ? 
0,Does that include hotels and meals ? 
0,"Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well . "
0,That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ? 
0,Eight hundred and fifty yuan . 
0,Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare . 
1,I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? 
0,"Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . "
1,Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
0,"We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . "
0,I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? 
0,"Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . "
0,It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . 
0,"Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . "
0,"ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? "
0,"Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ' m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ' s website . Is it still available ? "
0,Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? 
0,"No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information . "
0,"It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . "
0,The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ' m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ' m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . 
0,"Yes , do you have any rooms available ? "
0,No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car . 
0,"Please fill out this form , sir . "
0,Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . 
0,Why didn't you go to school yesterday ? 
0,I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . 
0,My stomach was bothering me . 
0,Are you feeling any better ? 
0,I'm still feeling a little sick . 
0,"I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? "
0,"Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray . "
0,"Yes , and please step over there . "
0,All right . What shall I do now ? 
0,Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine . 
0,I've got film in my bag . 
0,That's all right . This machine will not damage the film . 
0,Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it . 
0,Yes . Here is your boarding pass . 
0,"Welcome to Flash Foot , sir . How can I help you ? "
0,I ' d like extra prints made of these photos . 
0,Do you have your negatives ? 
0,Yes . Here they are . I ' Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
0,What size do you want the prints ? 
0,"Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . "
0,"Okay , they ' ll be ready for you in an hour . "
0,Is there anything I can do for you ? 
0,I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney . 
0,"Well , we have a package tour there . "
0,How much does it cost ? 
0,Does that include the insurance ? 
0,"Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . "
0,"Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? "
0,Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . 
0,"Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . "
0,"Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? "
0,"That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . "
0,We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? 
0,"Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? "
0,"Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents ."
0,"4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough ."
0,Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . 
0,It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? 
0,We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . 
0,"All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . "
0,Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . 
0,Thank you for your help . 
1,I'm glad these batteries are on sale . 
1,I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . 
0,But that's what the ad said . 
0,"I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . "
0,Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . 
0,"Yes , many people make that mistake . "
0,"Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . "
0,You're right . Many ads are like that . 
0,"Well , as long as I'm here . "
0,"Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . "
0,"Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . "
0,I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . 
0,"Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . "
0,"No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . "
0,"Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . "
0,"I agree , a man needs good career . But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . "
0,"So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? "
0,"Yeah , I ' Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . "

1,"Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . "
1,I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
0,"I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . "
1,"I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
0,Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White . 
0,"Who would you like to have paged again , sir ? "
0,Where would you like him to come ? 
0,Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having ? 
0,That ' s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ? 
0,"I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ' t stop itching . "
0,"The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream . "
0,The cream form is very popular . 
0,Can I do anything else to help with the itching ? 
0,You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .

0,"I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come . "
0,"Excuse me , are you Jane ? "
0,"Oh , are you in Class Four ? "
0,"No , I'm in Class There . "

1,"OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! "
0,"We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . "
0,I ' m interested in teaching at your school . 
0,Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? 
0,What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? 
0,I have a TEFL certificate . 
0,How many years of experience do you have ? 
0,I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
0,When did you get your TEFL certificate ? 
0,I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
0,Why do you want to teach at our school ? 
0,"Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . "
0,That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 
0,Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
0,Why is the car before us stopping ? 
0,Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . 
0,More and more people easily get irritated while driving . 
0,Yes . This is what is called road rage . 
0,"This is today ' s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ' clock , live for the workshop where you ' ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives ."
0,That ' s great . What are the prizes ? 
0,3000 RIB as bonus for each person .
0,To encourage the staff increases . 
0,"Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch ."
0,"At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ' clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC ."
0,"This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? "
0,"Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . "
0,We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
0,"Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . "
0,"The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... "
0,"Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . "
0,That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
0,"Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB ."
0,"What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment ."
1,"Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! "
0,"Hi , my name is Tom . "
0,"Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . "
0,Nice to meet you too . Melinda . 
0,"Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . "
1,"Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . "
0,Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
0,It looks like you guys work hard . 
0,"I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . "
0,Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 
0,What do you think of our price ? 
0,"Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? "
0,"Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . "
0,"I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . "
0,I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
0,"I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % ."
0,I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
0,"Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? "
0,We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
0,"Yes , this is the best we can do . "
0,I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . 
0,"So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? "
1,"It ' s great , dad . I don ' t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . "
0,"Even though you are only twelve , it ' s not too early to start saving a little money . "
0,I ' Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ' t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
0,"You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . "
0,But what if I need my money suddenly ? 
0,"The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . "
0,Great ! So it ' s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
0,Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ' t have to worry about that yet . Let ' s go make your first depot 
1,OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . 
0,Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 
0,"Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . "
0,Which bus do I have to change ? 
0,You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
0,"Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . "
1,"Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? "
0,Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 
0,"We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . "
0,Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 
0,Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 
0,"Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? "
0,Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
0,Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? 
0,"Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record ."
0,"Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? "
0,"All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . "
1,"Okay , that's good . I get it . "
1,"Kate , you never believe what's happened . "
0,Masha and Hero are getting divorced . 
1,You are kidding . What happened ? 
0,"Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce ."
1,That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? 
0,"Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . "
0,"That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? "
0,Early in the New Year I guess . 
0,"I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . "
0,"The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 ."
1,The line is connected . Please go ahead . 
0,Yes . Can I help you ? 
0,Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
0,Of course I remember you . 
0,I think I lost my wallet here . 
1,"Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . "
1,Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 
0,"No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? "
0,"Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor . Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? "
0,No . It's been empty the whole time . 
0,Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . 
0,"I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? "
0,Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
0,"No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down . It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . "
0,Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . 
0,I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house . But what should I do ? 
0,"Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home . Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . "
0,Should I call the police ? 
0,You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
0,Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . 
0,"I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . "
0,"Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? "
1,Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
0,That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . 
1,It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 
0,"Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . "
0,"Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? "
0,Have you got change for a thousand ? 
0,"May I come in , Mr Sun ? "
0,"I ' d rather you didn ' t , Miss Yang . I ' m very busy now . "
0,Can I try later then ? 
0,"Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? "
0,"Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? "
0,Do you mind if I sit down ? 
0,Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? 
0,I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? 
0,Yes . But why should you want to do that ? 
0,Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
0,Not at all . Go ahead . 
0,"Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? "
0,Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did . 
0,"Take me to the airport , please . "
0,Are you in a hurry ? 
0,I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
0,We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour . 
0,There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
0,Do you have small bills ? 
0,"No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? "
1,Here is your receipt . Thank you . 
0,Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly . 
0,When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
0,Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away . 
0,"Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points . "
0,Good . Now the other eye . 
0,"Well , this one is worse . "
0,"Never mind , just read as far as you can . "
0,I can only read the first three lines . 
0,Is there a car park near the supermarket ? 
0,"Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . "
0,"What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? "
0,It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
0,Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit . 
0,Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? 
1,"Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! "
0,"That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? "
1,"Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! "
0,"OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . "
0,How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? 
0,"Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . "
0,Do you have a better plan ? 
0,"Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? "
0,I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
0,How much would it be ? 
0,I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
0,"Can I help you , Miss ? "
0,I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
0,How soon do you want it ? 
0,Could you deliver it tomorrow ? 
0,Please handle the items carefully . 
0,We will pay by collect on delivery . 
0,"I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ' m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime . "
0,"Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ' Ve already made plans . "
0,"Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ' Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow . "
0,"I ' d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ' ll need me to stay ? "
0,What ' s your attitude when do wrong things at work ? 
0,Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ? 
0,"Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here . "
0,First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information . 
0,The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ? 
0,Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience . 
0,OK . I will call you soon . Bye now . 
0,"Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . "
0,It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . 
0,"You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . "
0,The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . 
0,"Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . "
0,"To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . "
0,"Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . "
0,It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . 
0,You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
0,"While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately "
0,"Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . "
0,"Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . "
0,"Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . "
0,What are you doing in Australia ? 
0,I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? 
0,"Oh , right . What time is it there ? "
0,"It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?"
0,Yes - four o'clock in the morning . 
1,4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
1,That's OK . I'm awake now . 
0,John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 
0,"I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . "
0,"Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? "
1,Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! 
0,Take it easy . They will get caught . 
0,"Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ? "
1,"Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . "
0,I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ? 
0,"I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back ."
1,"That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !"
0,What can I do for you ? 
0,I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . 
0,"Yes , it's true . It has been delayed . "
0,Could you please tell me why ? 
0,"Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain . "
0,How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ? 
0,"I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon . "
0,"We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ? "
0,It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight . 
0,"Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye ! "
1,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
0,"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . "
1,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
0,I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?
0,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
0,"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? "
0,"I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . "
0,"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . "
0,I have plenty of gas . 
0,"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . "
0,So what can we do ? 
0,"Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible . "
1,Alright . That's a good idea . 
0,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
0,"Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . "
1,"Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . "
0,Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
0,"Hey , buddy , can ' t you see there ' s a line ? "
1,"Oh , sorry . I didn ' t know . "
0,What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ? 
1,"No , I ' m afraid not . "
0,"Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . "
0,It ' s all right . Where are you going ? 
0,I wanted to see the White House . 
0,"Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . "
0,"It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A ."
1,"Oh , well thank you very much . "
0,"I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . "
0,What kind of drink would you like with that ? 
0,Just coke will be fine . 
0,"Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes ."
1,"That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . "
0,"That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? "
0,"That will be 25RMB , please"
0,Do you have any night tours ? 
0,"Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes ."
0,Is that a guided tour ? 
0,That's fine . Let's get on the bus . 
0,I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . 
0,We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . 
0,Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . 
0,I would like to purchase some meat . 
0,What kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
0,"First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef . "
0,A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
0,What else will you be needing ? 
0,I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts . 
0,The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
0,What's the total price for the chicken ? 
0,It's going to be $ 12.15 .
1,"Okay , I think that will be all for me today . "
0,I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . 
0,"Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . "
1,"Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . "
0,Do you sell direct to shops ? 
0,"Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . "
0,Do you keep a stock of these things ? 
0,"In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . "
0,"Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal ."
0,Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
0,"The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much ."
0,"According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? "
0,"We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . "
0,"We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... "
0,Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
0,"Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect ."
0,"Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . "
0,"Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . "
0,"Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? "
0,"Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction ."
0,"All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . "
0,Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . 
0,"Excuse me , I ' m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . "
0,"Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? "
0,"Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet . "
0,"Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? "
0,Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? 
0,"Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . "
0,Are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
0,Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . 
0,I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . 
0,"All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? "
0,How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . 
0,I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
0,"Hello sir , may I help you ? "
0,"Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . "
0,"I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . "
1,"Sounds good . I don ' t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . "
0,"We have this new ETC smart phone . It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are ."
0,Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . 
0,One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 
1,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
1,Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
0,Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
1,"I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! "
0,"What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . "
0,Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
0,"We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . "
0,Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
0,"I ' ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there . "
0,"Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? "
0,Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ' t understand . 
0,From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked . 
0,"I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ? "

0,How does the political system work in your country ?

0,"Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? "

0,"Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . "

0,"Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? "
0,"We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend . "

0,My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
0,What kind of watch is it ? 
0,It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . 
1,"Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? "
0,What are your thoughts on the apartment ? 
1,I think that it ' s absolutely gorgeous . 
0,There aren ' t any problems with the apartment ? 
0,"I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . "
0,I did notice a few stains in the carpet . 
0,We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . 
0,"Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? "
0,That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
1,I ' m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . 
1,It is . I love it . 
0,"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? "
0,Could I try it on ? 
0,"Please do , the fitting-room is over there . "
0,It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? 
0,I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? 
0,OK . How much does it cost ? 
0,"Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? "
0,"As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . "
0,"Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling ."
0,So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . 
0,"The ball is in your court , Mrs . Wang . What price would you suggest ? "
0,"To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . "
0,"That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . "
0,"I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . "
0,"Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? "
0,"Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? "
0,Good . Friday morning at 9 .
0,Good morning.This is Mary . Can I speak to Anne please ? 
1,I ' m sorry She isn ' t in at the momment . She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? 
1,Thank you . But I will call her later 
0,"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? "
0,"I ' m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . "
0,"Yeah , I got home around two . "
0,"We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . "
0,I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . 
0,"Have you got the time , Tom ? "
1,"Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! "
0,But you bought it only last month . 
0,"Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . "
0,How long will it take us to get there ? 
0,I think about ten minutes by bus . 
0,"It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . "
0,Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
0,"Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? "
0,I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
0,"Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year ."
0,"I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? "
0,"Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . "
0,"Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? "
0,"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . "
0,"I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . "
0,"Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . "
0,Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? 
0,I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . 
0,"I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? "
0,"Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . "
1,"You are so kind , you helped me a lot . "
0,"Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? "
0,"Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . "
0,"Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? "
0,"Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? "
0,Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . 
0,What do you recommend we do ? 
0,I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . 
0,"I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . "
0,Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
0,You should go to the dentist . 
0,"Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . "
0,It always hurts . I hate going . 
0,"Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . "
0,"O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go . "
0,Good . You'll feel better after you do . 
0,"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . "
0,"Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . "
0,How long does it take to get there ? 
0,"About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . "
0,"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! "
0,"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . "
1,Great ! I ' ll take it . 
0,Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
0,I understand . Thank you very much ! 
0,I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . 
0,A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? 
0,The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . 
0,So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
0,It sounds like it will be . 
0,I really hope it doesn't get cold . 
0,"That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . "
0,"The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . "
0,That is true . The weather is constantly changing . 
0,It would be nice if the weather would never change . 
0,"That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . "
0,True . Predictable weather would make life easier . 
0,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . "
0,"If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . "
0,"Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . "
0,"But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . "
0,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
0,"Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . "
0,"You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . "
0,What's special about these things ? 
0,"Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . "
1,Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . 
1,"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . "
0,"You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . "
1,"Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . "
0,"Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . "
0,Yes . I want to get a better job . 
0,Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
0,I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . 
0,"Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? "
0,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . 
0,"OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . "
0,Thank you so much for your advice . 
0,And every best wish for your new job . 
0,The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? 
0,"Let me see . Oh , No . 11 ."
0,"Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in ."
0,Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ' s nice that we ' Ve got a window seat .
0,Let's put our suitcases on the rack . 
0,"Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . "
0,"So , how should we get to the theatre ? "
1,"I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . "
0,It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
1,"It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . "
0,"We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . "
0,"Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . "
0,"If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? "
0,"We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . "
0,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
0,Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
0,It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
1,"Thanks , that was nice of you . "
0,"See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! "
0,Let's go over this plan again . 
0,"From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . "
0,"And that is mostly flat , right ? "
0,"Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . "
0,"And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? "
0,That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . 
0,"It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . "
0,Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
0,"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? "
1,I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
0,"I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet ."
0,"Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . "
0,"No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . "
0,All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
0,"Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . "
0,I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . 
0,"It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . "
0,I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . 
0,Why don't you try counting sheep ? 
0,I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . 
0,"That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . "
0,Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? 
0,"If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . "
0,I promise I'll go to sleep soon . 
0,"No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . "
1,See you in the morning . 
0,"I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . "
0,How about your psychological resilience ? 
0,"I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . "
0,How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
0,"I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . "
0,You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . 
0,Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . 
0,Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . 
0,I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . 
0,Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . 
0,Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? 
0,"I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . "
0,I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . 
0,"Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . "
1,"Oh , I remember now . Very nice to meet you again . "
0,I made my little brother cry . 
0,I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? 
0,Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . 
0,Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? 
0,We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? 
0,"Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . "
0,I can help you with that . 
0,Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
0,"Yes , we are on the same plane . "
0,But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . 
0,So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . 
0,Yes . It ' s quite troublesome . 
0,Why not go and find a porter ? 
0,"Billy , you don ' t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . "
0,But Mom ! Today we ' re playing football ! I love football ! 
0,You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ? 
0,I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
0,It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
0,I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
0,"A little , but not much . "
0,Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast . 
0,"If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? "
0,"If you are better , but I doubt you will be . "
1,"You're going out of your way for us , I believe . "
1,You are our honored guests . 
0,Are there any vacancies still available ? 
0,Yes . We need a plumber here . 
0,"I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . "
0,I am sorry . They are not available now . 
0,"My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . "
1,"Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . "
0,"Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? "
1,"Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? "
0,There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . 
0,The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
1,"You know , that is one of my favorites ! "
0,"OK , I'll take one order of that . "
0,You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . 
1,Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
1,I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . 
0,What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
0,"Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? "
0,"Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out ."
0,"I would like to speak to you , if you don ' t mind . "
0,What would you like to speak to me about ? 
0,I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election . 
0,I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign . 
0,That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . 
0,"I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . "
0,Are you planning on voting ? 
0,I ' m going to vote . 
0,Go to your polling place early on Election Day . 
1,I will . Good luck with your volunteering . 
1,We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
0,Yes . I promise it will not happen again . 
0,We look forward to your settlement at an early date . 
0,We will inform you as soon as possible . 
0,"Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? "
0,"Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . "
0,"Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? "
0,"At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . "
1,"Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . "
1,Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . 
0,I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . 
0,Where on earth are we ? 
0,"Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . "
0,What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? 
0,"I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . "
0,"Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . "
0,It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . 
0,Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ' m calling from room number 627 .
0,"Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? "
0,Is it possible to change to another room ? 
0,Could you please tell me why ? 
0,My room is facing the swimming pool . It ' s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . 
0,So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . 
0,Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . 
0,I ' Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
0,That ' s fine . Can I move now ? 
0,Sure . I ' ll send the bellman to help you . 
0,How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
0,"Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles ."
0,"Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . "
0,"No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . "
0,"Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . "
0,Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
0,"You may ask questions about us , if you have any . "
0,All right . When can I start ? 
0,What are you doing here today ? 
0,I would like to fight my ticket . 
0,Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
0,"Yes , the officer is here today . "
0,"I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . "
0,Do you believe that the officer lied ? 
0,"There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . "
0,Your license plate was caught on camera ? 
0,A picture of my license plate was never taken . 
0,"Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . "
1,Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . 
0,"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? "
0,"Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . "
0,"Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . "
0,That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . 
0,"What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? "
0,"Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . "
0,"So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? "
0,"Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . "
0,"Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . "
0,"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . "
0,what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
0,how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
1,that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
0,"me , too . What did you have in mind ? "
0,"I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . "
1,"I agree . They're very lovely , especially "" Huan Huan "" . "
0,"is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? "
0,"the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . "
0,"oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? "
0,I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
0,"there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . "
1,it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
1,Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! 
0,You don ' t have to eat them . I don ' t mind . 
0,Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! 
0,No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . 
1,But I don ' t like them ! It ' s not fair ! 
0,"You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . "
0,"Ok ... actually , I don ' t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . "
0,"I ' ll remember that for next time . You ' ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? "
0,It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . 
0,"It ' s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ' s your general impression , may I ask ? "
0,"Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . "
0,That ' s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . 
0,"The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . "
0,Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . 
0,Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . 
0,Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . 
1,Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . 
0,Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
0,What about supply of parts to the production line ? 
0,"Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . "
0,What about the smaller components ? 
0,They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 
1,I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . 
0,"Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . "
0,That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . 
0,I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? 
0,Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . 
0,Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . 
0,What does your job involve ? 
0,I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business . 
0,How many languages can you speak ? 
0,"Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . "
0,You mean you can read and write both of them ? 
0,"No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . "
0,Can you read and write English well ? 
0,I can speak the language better than read and write . 
0,Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? 
0,I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
0,Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? 
0,The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
0,What can I get for you ? Here is the menu . 
0,"Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ? "

0,"OK , what does that entail ? "
0,"It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances ."
0,"Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?"
0,"Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate ."
1,"I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? "

0,What should I do about it ? 
0,You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . 
0,"OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . "
0,Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? 
0,Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep .

0,"OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back . "
0,"Hello , how can I be of service ? "
0,Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
0,The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . 
0,"Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated ."
0,"Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? "
0,"Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . "
0,Could it be the battery ? 
0,"No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems . "
0,"Well , I suppose it could be the gas . "
0,"No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . "
0,Perhaps it's the starter then ? 
0,"What do you reading , Linda ? "
0,"I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . "

0,The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 .
0,How do I get to King's Cross ? 
0,The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here . 
0,Can you show me on the map ? 
0,It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .

0,The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . 
0,"We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard ."
1,It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 
0,Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally 
0,"Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ' ll send our technicians to repair them . "
0,"Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee ."
0,"I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee ."
0,All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .

0,"Sure , when those never ending meetings . "
0,"I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . "
0,"No , I haven't had the pleasure . "
0,Come and meet her now . 
1,"Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . "
0,Did you have hotel card or something ? 
0,"Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here . "
0,"Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . "
0,I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? 
1,The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
0,I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . 
0,"So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ? "
0,"Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced . "
0,How long did it take you to do the tiling . 
0,"As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether ."
1,I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
1,"You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself ."
0,"I'd like to see that pen , please . "
0,"No , the other one in the brown case . "
0,It's very smooth . I'll take it . 
0,I ' Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . 
0,"We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days ."
0,"Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price ."
0,I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . 
0,I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources . 
0,But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . 
0,"I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years . "
0,"There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . "
0,"Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose . "

0,"I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . "
0,I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? 
0,I would rather work full-time . 
0,"I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? "
0,"I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year ."
0,"My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . "
0,I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . 
0,Do you know any places ? 
0,Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . 
1,Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . 
0,How much do are you looking to spend ?

0,it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . 
0,"I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . "
0,I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . 
0,all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . 
0,"perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . "
0,"I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . "
0,that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . 
0,"you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . "

0,"That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? "
0,A dressy party would be fun !

0,"Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? "
0,Maybe we could do both ! 
1,Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . 
0,I can't find the price tag .

0,Ours are of really good quality . 
0,"I see , please wrap it . "
0,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? "

All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . "
0,So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
0,"Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . "
0,Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . 
0,"In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . "

0,"I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please . "
0,Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged . 
0,"Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please . "
0,"Glad to meet you , Mr . White . "

1,"That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? "
0,I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . 
0,Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
0,I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ? 
0,"I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . "
0,Would you care to make another appointment ?

0,I see . I can tell Mr . Thomas that you phoned . 
0,I see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ” . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
0,There ' s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price . 
0,I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
0,Which tests do you mean ? 
0,You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ” 
0,"Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ' t take them seriously . "
0,"Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ' m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . "

0,"Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? "
0,"Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . "

0,I kind of want pizza . 
0,I ate pizza the other day . 
0,"So , what do you feel like eating then ? "
0,I already had a burger yesterday . 
0,What are we going to do ? 
0,We can just each get what we want to get . 
1,That sounds like a plan . 
0,Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
0,I think they sell both at the cafeteria . 
0,Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
0,"Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . "
0,How about your nursing education ? 
0,I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
0,Can you manage English conversation ? 
0,"Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . "
0,"Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? "
0,"My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl "
0,"Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? "
0,"For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . "
0,Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? 
0,"No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy"
0,"If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? "
0,"That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like "
0,Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
0,"I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! "
0,"Ok , let ' s go through this one more time . I don ' t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! "
0,"I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . "
0,"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . "
0,"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? "
0,"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . "
1,Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ' s all set right ? 
0,"No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . "
0,You know what ? I ' ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
0,"No , he is at work now . "
0,May I have his office phone number please ? 
0,What about driving to Shanghai ? 
0,"Driving ? No way , it's too far . "
0,I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ? 
0,"Too long , and you do not have much time . "
0,Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room . 
0,Could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
0,They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them . 
0,"Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ? "
0,"Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please ."
0,"Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? "
0,"Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period . "
1,"Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment . "
0,"Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? "
0,The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . 
0,How long will it take me to get there ? 
0,It's about a ten-minute walk . 
1,That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . 
0,Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? 
0,"No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station ."
1,OK ! Thank you very much ! 
0,I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . 
0,"Good , if you ' ll excuse me , I ' ll go over the sheet right now . "
0,I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . 
0,I ' m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . 
0,"We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ' s reasonable , isn ' t it ? "
0,"Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ' ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . "
0,The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ' s settle that matter first . 
0,"Well , as I ' Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ' re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent ."
0,"When I say your prices are much too high , I don ' t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent ."
0,How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 
0,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help ."
0,Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
0,I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ' s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
0,"Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ? "
1,"Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . "
0,Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
0,Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 
0,Next left then right ? OK . 
0,"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . "
0,"I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' "
0,I'm trying to find a post office . 
0,Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . 
0,Should I take the bus ? 
0,No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . 
0,It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . 
0,Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . 
0,But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .

1,This is too good to be true . 
1,"And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? "
1,"Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . "

0,"Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? "

0,"Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . "
0,"Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . "

0,Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
0,The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .

1,"I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . "

0,"Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . "
0,"Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . "
0,Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? 
0,"Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . "
0,"Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . "
0,What can I do for you ? 
0,My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . 
0,What symptoms does she have ? 
0,Fever and a bad cough . 
0,"I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . "
0,What kind of medicine does she need ? 
0,How many pills for each time ? 
0,"Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . "
0,Do you believe in god ? 
0,Not at all . I ' m an agnostic . do you ? 
0,I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ? 
0,I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
0,"I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet . "
0,I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
0,"Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . "
0,Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
0,Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
0,They're going skiing in Colorado . 
1,What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
1,"You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . "
0,"I'm sick of it , too . "
1,"The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . "

0,"( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now . "
0,This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . 
1,"Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! "

0,Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ? 
0,"Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc . "
0,"That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead . "
0,"There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like . "
0,That's what I am going to do . 
0,"If you have any problem , please come to me . "
0,I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 
0,You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
0,That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 
0,Do you have any special request ? 
0,I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
0,So that means you are shopping for presents ? 
0,"Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . "
0,"Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . "
1,Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . 
0,"I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . "
0,You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . 
0,"As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . "
1,"Wow , you are the expert on it . "
0,Operator . Can I help you ?

0,"What the number I gave you , operator ? "
1,"Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number ."
0,Are you sure this time ? 
0,OK . Let me try again . 
0,Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? 
0,"Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . "
0,That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . 
0,And please let white color dominate . 
0,OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? 
0,Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . 
0,"Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . "
0,Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .

0,"Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr . Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . "
0,Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 
0,"I will . Many thanks , Mr . Black . "
0,Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
0,"I've gotten six , I think . "
0,Did you pay your fines ? 
0,How much are the parking tickets ? 
0,I just got a parking ticket . 
0,You should probably pay the fine soon . 
0,I'm going to pay it today . 
0,"Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? "
0,"I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? "
0,Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
0,"Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract ."
0,"Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? "
0,"Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? "
0,"No , I ' d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . "
0,All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . 
0,"Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . "
0,"Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? "
0,"Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . "
0,You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
0,"Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . "
1,You're finally here ! What took so long ? 
0,I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
0,It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
0,"I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . "
0,perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
0,I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
0,"It would be better for the environment , too . "
0,I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
0,Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
0,The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
0,"Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . "
1,That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
0,"So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? "
0,"Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . "
0,"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . "
0,I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . 
0,That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . 
0,"Sure , for at least three thousand per month . "
0,That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . 
1,"I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . "
0,Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday . Aren ' t they ready ? 
0,They'll be ready by this afternoon . 
1,"Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning ."
1,Is that right ? We're very sorry . 
0,"I thought it was "" the same day "" service . Anyway , please do hurry . "
1,I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
0,"Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ? "
0,"Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? "
0,I want to effect payment under an L / C today . 
0,"No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . "
0,That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? 
0,"It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 ."
0,"How can I help you , sir ? "
0,I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
0,"Sorry , could you tell me your name ? "
0,I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
0,Do you have an appointment ? 
0,"Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm ."
0,I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 
0,She will be back soon . 
0,Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? 
0,Sure . May I take your measurements ? 
0,"Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . "
0,"I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?"
0,"The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?"
0,"Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?"
0,Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue . 
0,We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .

0,"I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas . "
0,It seems that many boys are fighting there . 
1,Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
1,the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
0,exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
1,"on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . "
0,"as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . "
0,"I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse "
0,what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
0,it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
0,"I see , so it's similar to global warming ? "
0,"they're related to one another , yes . "
0,I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
0,"people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . "
0,people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 
0,"I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . "
0,Would you like some cookies ? I just made them . 
1,"Thank you . Yes , I would . "
0,"These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . "
0,I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious . Are they hard to make ? 
0,"No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here . See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions . "
1,That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight . 
0,I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
0,"Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow . The price is $ 110 ."
0,"Well , I want to stay under $ 100 ."
0,I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons . The price is the same . 
0,"How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? "
0,It ' s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
0,Oh yes . I ' Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
0,You really shouldn ' t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
0,"Ok , I ' Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ' t I ? "
0,"Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . "
0,"I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? "
0,That ' s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 
1,"These machines aren ' t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . "
1,"I am sorry , you have the wrong number . "
1,"Oh , I am really sorry . "
0,Can you give me a hand with the dishes ? 
0,Sure . Should I wash or dry ? 
0,I wash and you'll dry . 
0,"Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ? "
0,"Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is . "
0,"Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there . "
0,"Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post . "
0,"Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? "
0,Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
0,"Just a moment , please . Your name ? "
0,Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .

0,Have you made a reservation ? 
0,You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? 
0,"Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . "
0,"Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . "
0,Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 
0,"Yes , I need to talk to him . "
0,I'll put the call through then . 
0,I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ? 
0,"Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? "
0,"Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? "
0,What is the difference between them ? 
0,"The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . "
0,"Well , I think the cable is better . "
0,"OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone . "

0,I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . 
0,"if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! "

0,That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?

0,"Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?"
0,You seem to be upset . What ' s eating you ? 
1,It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
0,Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . 
1,"Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track . "
0,"He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans . "
0,"Bring me some toast , please . "
0,Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? 
0,"Peter , it's time to get up . "

0,"Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater . "

0,I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning . 
0,OK sir . At what time ? 
0,"Well , how long is it from here to the train station ? "
0,"If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes ."
0,Then please wake me up at 7 : OO . Thank you .
0,"All right , Bill . Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . "
0,"Then , you are to walk to work . "
0,Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . 
0,"Use the stairs , never the elevator . "
0,"And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball . "
0,"OK , you can stop now . It ' s time for the dance class . "
1,Dance class ! I don't know how . 
0,I have a reservation . My name is John Sandals . 
0,"May I see your ID , please , Mr . Sandals ? "
0,"Thank you . Do you have a credit card , Mr . Sandals ? "

0,"Yes , it sounds like everything I expected . "
0,"Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone ."
0,"Sandy , can you help me contact these people ? "
0,"Sure , what do you want me to tell them ? "
0,"Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes . "
0,"Ok , where can I find their telephone number ? "
0,They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . 
0,"Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? "
0,"Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers . "
0,Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ? 
0,"Then , you should e-mail them with the information . "
0,Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? 
0,They should have then listed on their resumes . 
0,And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ? 
0,Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . 
0,Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? 
0,"Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up . "
0,Did you leave a voice message ? 
0,I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . 
0,I see . What did you tell her ? 
0,I told her that she should call me back at my office number . 
0,"Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . "
0,"Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . "
0,One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? 
0,Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . 
0,Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .

0,We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
1,"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . "
0,Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 
1,Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
0,Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . 
1,Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
0,Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
0,I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that . 
0,"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . "
1,Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
0,"Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ? "
0,Well . Have you got his permission ? 
0,Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ' clock . 
0,"What ' s your name , please ? "
0,"The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . "
0,Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . 
0,But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . 
0,That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . 
0,"Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . "
0,"Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position . "
0,"I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone . "

0,"I'm sorry , he's out at the moment . "
0,When do you expect him back ? 
0,I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
0,"Well , may I leave a message ? "
0,Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
0,Ok . Does he know your number ? 
0,I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .

0,"I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . "
1,"Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ' t it ? "
0,"Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ? "
0,Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
0,Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ? 
0,The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .
0,I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
0,"Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan ."
0,What about the loan repayment ? 
0,"You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments . "
0,Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? 
0,Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank . 
1,That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much . 
0,You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment . 
0,That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ' t you ? 
0,We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix . 
0,Where do you think you have problems ? 
0,"There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen . "
0,"You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before . "
0,You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment . 
0,I will fix these problems when I get around to it . 
0,I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately . 
1,You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal ! 
1,I can ' t believe these skirts are so cheap . 
0,"I know and they are really nice , too . "
0,I ' ll have to get a couple in different colors . 
0,"Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . "
1,"Good idea , especially at this price . "
0,"Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . "
1,Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? 
0,"I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too ."
0,But I don't speak English at all . 
0,That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . 
0,Really ? When is it on ? 
0,"It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes ."

0,The radio has brought us lots of convenience . 
0,"Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . "
0,"With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . "
0,So we should take the advantage of it . 
0,"I ' m thinking about getting a pet , but I ' m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? "
0,"Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . "
0,"I ' m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ' t need to care of very much . Actually , I ' d like a pet that ' s a little unusual . I don't ' really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? "
0,Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? 
0,"Not really . By the way , I don ' t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . "
0,"We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . "
1,That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? 
0,"Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? "
0,I like the red one . What do they eat ? 
0,"You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ' d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . "
1,Thanks a lot . What I ' ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . 
0,That ' s fine . You shouldn ' t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . 
0,I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order . 
0,"May I have your flight number , please ? "
0,"Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour ."

0,"Hilton hotel , may I help you ? "
0,We would like to book a table for 6 at 7:00 in the evening .
0,"OK , sir . We will arrange one for you . "
0,Can we bring drinks by ourselves ? 
0,"Sorry , sir . It's not allowed in our hotel . "
0,Hello . This is Dr . Galas Office . Can I help you ? 
0,Yes . I ' d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ? 
0,Sure . Let me check his schedule . How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 ?
0,I ' m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ? 
0,I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
0,"You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ? "
0,"Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 ."
0,"Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am ."
0,What do you think of the project ? 
0,Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us . 
0,Are you interested in making this investment ? 
0,"We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do . "
0,"David , how is your interview ? "
0,I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 
0,Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
0,We can have a rest now after this tough interview . 
0,Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . 
0,Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 
0,Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 
0,I am getting to know your meaning . 
0,"Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it . "
0,"When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ? "
0,My appointment was on Wednesday . 
0,At what time was that appointment ? 
0,I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ? 
0,I want to change to next Tuesday . 
0,What time would you prefer ? 
0,I would prefer three o ' clock in the afternoon . 
0,I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule . 
0,"En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ? "
0,There are so many here . The men with red hats are the porters . 
0,"Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . "
0,Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
0,"Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ' s showing your respect to your co-workers . "
0,"Well , but for this one , don ' t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? "
0,"Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . "
0,I didn ' t pay attention to that . 
0,Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
0,"It's a difficult choice . The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . "
0,"We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . "
0,Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . 
0,That's true . But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
1,Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
0,So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
0,"I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . "
0,"Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey . Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? "
0,"The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles ."
0,We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 
0,Did you hear about Lulu ? 
0,She and Vic broke up and now she ' s asked for a transfer . 
1,Get out of here ! I didn ' t even know they were dating ! 
0,No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . 
0,Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? 
0,"Well , I'm not too happy about it . "
0,"Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions . It ' ll have to be done again . "
0,"Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ? "
0,"oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday . "
0,"ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ? "
0,"yes , please . Do you take credit cards ? "
0,"yes , we accept all major credit cards . "
0,and how about Internet access ? 
0,there's free Internet access in the lobby . 
0,is it available in the rooms ? 
0,that's OK . Is breakfast included ? 
0,"yes , breakfast is included and parking is available . "
0,fantastic . Thank you very much . 
0,you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
0,"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . "
0,You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 
1,"You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ' t sleep well . What ' s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . "
0,"What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ? "
0,Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ' s a grocery store just around the corner . 
0,What about things other than food ? 
0,"Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores ."
0,Are there small shops near here as well ? 
0,"Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques ."
1,"Well , that sounds just wonderful . "
1,"Yes , it ' s a really nice neighborhood . "
0,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . "
0,"Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . "
0,But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
0,But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
0,"Well , only you liked it really , darling . "
0,"Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . "
0,More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
0,"Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . "
0,"It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . "
1,You refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
0,"I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . "
0,Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
0,That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . 
0,"I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . "
0,"We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . "
0,Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? 
0,"You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . "
0,"Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? "
0,"The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . "
0,"Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? "
0,The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
1,"Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . "
0,"Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . "
0,"Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application . "
0,OK . Here is my application form and all the documents . 
0,Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ? 
0,Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world . 
0,OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ? 
0,Have you finished all you preparation ? 
0,"What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? "
0,"Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !"
1,"Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future . "
1,"Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better . "
0,I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you . 
0,I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ? 
0,"I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions . "
0,How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
0,We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . 
0,Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
0,"It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children . "
0,"Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? "
0,"In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . "
1,Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you . 
0,Would you like anything else ? 
0,"No , thanks . Please bring us the bill . "
0,All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ? 
0,Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .
1,Here you are . Thank you 
0,"If this coat doesn't fit , may I bring it back later ? "
1,"Sorry , We don't take returns on sale items . "
0,What are the attractions of that city ? 
0,It's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air . 
0,"Oh , that's what I am looking for . Do you have a reduction for 6 persons ?"
0,"Yes , sir . We offer a 10 % discount for groups more than 5 ."
0,I would like to order a waistcoat . 
0,Have you chosen the material ? 
0,"Yes , I want it to made of tweed . "
0,Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
0,When will it be available ? 
0,"Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ? "
0,I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . 
0,And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . 
0,"I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . "
0,Can I get you anything to drink ? 
0,"Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . "
0,Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . 
0,What is your salary at present ? 
0,"My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year ."
0,What are your salary expectations now ? 
0,"I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year ."
0,That's a little more than we had planned . 
0,I think you'll find I'm worth that . 
0,"I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?"
0,"Yes , it is quite reasonable . "
0,Excuse me . I've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time . 
0,"Yes , sir . Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen . "
1,"Thank you for waiting . It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid . "
1,We have an appointment in half an hour . 
0,Do you have anything else I can have instead ? 
0,"Well , yes . How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once . "
0,"I'll take beef stew , then . "
1,"Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl ! "
1,"Congratulations , Bob ! That ' s great news , what ' s her name ? "
0,We ' Ve named her Alice after my wife ' s grandmother . 
1,That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! 
0,"Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ? "
0,You can find one at the end of the street . 
0,Are there any signs there ? 
0,No.but there are quite many cars . 
0,Would Dr . Black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ?
0,"I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation ."
0,Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?
0,Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
0,You should go to the dentist . 
0,"Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . "
1,It always hurts . I hate going . 
0,"Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . "
0,"O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go . "
0,Good . You feel better after you do . 
0,"Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? "
0,Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? 
0,"Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... "
0,"Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . "
0,"You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? "
1,"Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it ."
0,"Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . "
0,But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . 
0,"Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . "
0,I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . 
0,"I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? "
0,Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . 
0,"Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into . We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . "
0,I really want to make something for dinner . 
0,What are you going to cook ? 
0,I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . 
1,A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . 
0,I don't know how to make that . 
0,All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . 
1,"That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? "
0,The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . 
0,Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . 
0,What's the next thing I need to do ? 
0,Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . 
0,How do I submit an expense report ? 
0,You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
0,You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 
0,"Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you . "

0,"I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . "
0,How long do you think she'll be ? 
0,I really can't say how long she'll be . 
0,"Can I leave a message , please ? "
0,Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
0,"Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . "

0,Wait a moment . Here you are . 
0,"By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend . "
0,"Can you help me out , Chuck ? "
0,"I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . "
0,"Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . "
0,Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
0,Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
0,What seems to be the problem ? 
0,"I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . "
0,"Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? "
1,"No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! "
0,"You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? "
0,"Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? "
0,"Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . "
1,"Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . "
1,Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? 
1,"Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . "
1,What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . 
0,According to some studies it may cause cancer . 
0,"Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . "
0,I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . 
0,I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 
0,"Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? "
0,"Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . "
0,"Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? "
1,"Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . "
0,This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
1,I am still waiting for their call . 
0,"Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . "
0,"Do you have any seat preferences , sir ? "
0,"Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ? "
0,Yes . Would you like a window seat ? 
0,"If one's available , please . But not over the wing . "
0,morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ? 
0,Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips . 
0,"Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ? "
0,"Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon ."
0,I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . 
0,Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
0,It was for my Master Card . 
0,You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago . 
0,I haven't got it in the mail yet . 
0,The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . 
0,What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? 
0,Maybe you should call your post office . 
0,"But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ? "
0,"Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake . "
0,"Okay , thank you very much for your help . "
0,Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day . 
0,"Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ? "
0,Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum . 
0,Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum . 
0,What a shame that we can't take pictures . 
0,"OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ? "
0,I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
1,Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
0,"I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . "
0,"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves "" The King . "" "
0,I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
0,Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
1,"Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . "
0,"You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . "
1,"This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? "
0,The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 
1,Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
0,"How are you doing , Jim ? "
0,"Fine , just fine . How about you ? "
1,"I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . "
1,"Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . "
0,I think I caught a cold . 
0,Do you have any symptoms ? 
0,Do you have a fever ? 
0,"I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . "
0,"You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise . "
0,What kind of place shall we rent ? 
0,"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . "
0,Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
0,"Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . "
0,"I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . "
1,"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . "
0,"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . "
0,How much do you think the rent will be ? 
0,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
0,I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . 
0,"Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? "
0,The earliest we can do is by the end of June . 
0,Did you have any working experience during college ? 
0,"Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model . "
0,What did you learn from your part-time jobs ? 
0,"I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales . "
1,Smells good ! What ' s for breakfast ? 
1,"Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! "
1,"Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! "
1,Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 
0,"Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . "
1,Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . 
0,Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup ! 
0,Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ? 
0,Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
0,So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ? 
0,"Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now . "
0,Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Will you help me ? 
0,Would you turn off the tap ? 
0,Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ? 
0,I'll have our housekeeper come right away . 
0,I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep . 
0,"When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub . "
0,Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 
0,Would you like some more coffee ? 
0,No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
0,The waitress is bringing the bill right now . 
0,"This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? "
0,"Yes , this waitress did a great job . "
0,"OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 ."
0,What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
0,"Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?"
0,"Yes , 20 % would be perfect ."
0,Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
1,"Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! "
1,I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 
0,It ' s time for me to go now . 
0,Would you like me to go with you ? 
0,I ' d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
0,Do you want to type that letter ? 
0,I ' d rather you typed it . 
0,Do you want to tell her ? 
0,I ' d rather you told her . 
0,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head . 
0,What crime did I commit ? 
0,"You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ' Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed .

0,"Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . "
0,"Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . "
0,"Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . "
0,"Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? "
0,"Well , do you have any suggestions ? "

0,"Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? "
0,"Tom , it's time for you to go to bed . "
0,Operator . May I help you ? 
0,"Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ? "

1,"No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . "
0,What's our target audience for this campaign ? 
0,"This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . "
0,Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
0,"Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . "
0,"Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? "
0,"Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year ."
0,"John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . "
0,"Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . "
0,"John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . "
1,"Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . "
0,"Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . "
1,"Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . "
0,How can I help you today ? 
0,I am returning something that I bought yesterday . 
0,What would you like to return ?

0,"Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? "
0,Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . 
0,"Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? "

0,I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . 
0,Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
0,Thank you . Here you are . 
0,How do you want your money ? 
0,Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
0,All right . Please wait for a moment . 
0,"Could you fill in this form , please ? "
0,Have you got any identification ? 
0,"Yes , here's my ID card . "
1,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
0,What ? What did you buy ? 
1,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
0,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
0,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick . "
0,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
0,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
0,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . "
0,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
0,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . "
0,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
0,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
0,"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! "
0,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . "
0,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
0,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
0,"Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? "
0,"Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ' m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision ."
0,"Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . "
0,"Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ' t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ' s the peace sign ."
1,"Wow , Arthur ! You ' re as blind as a bat ! "
1,"Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . "
0,"Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . "
0,"Arthur , that ' s the bathroom . "
0,Would you like some more coffee ? 
0,No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
0,Good luck finding the waitress ! 
0,The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? 
0,"I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . "
0,Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . 
0,So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
0,How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
0,I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
0,"I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . "
0,I think that we should leave 10 % .
0,$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
0,"I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th ."

0,"Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? "
0,"Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . "
0,"Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery ."
1,But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! 
0,"Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . "
0,Would you care for a drink ? 
0,Let's go practice your driving .

0,"Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . "
0,Would you like something to drink ? 
0,"No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . "
0,"So , you're a serious coffee drinker . "
0,"Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . "
0,"Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something . For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? "
0,"No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . "
0,"Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? "
0,I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . 
0,I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . 
0,It is about the staff meetings . You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . 
0,"Well , I have been thinking about it . And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . "
0,"The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week . We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . "
0,You mean because people have to go across town to get here . 
0,Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . 
0,"That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . "
0,I think they are important too . That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . 
0,I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . 
0,"Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . "
0,I also think the meetings should be more focused . And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . 
0,You mean you want to run the meetings ? 
0,"No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . "
0,Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . 
0,"I really think it would work . The meetings could be longer , and better organized . "
0,"I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do . Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . "
1,Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . 
0,"I will call the managers . Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this "" new style . "" "

0,"No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches . "

0,"Yes , I would like to exchange some money . "
0,what currency would you like to trade in ? 
0,I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
0,"No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? "
0,"Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? "
0,"It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35 . Will that be all right ?"
0,"I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !"
0,"Has your son started school yet , Tom ? "
0,"Next week , it ' s going to be quite a shock for him ! "

1,"Yes , of course . Thank you very much . "
1,You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB 
0,"Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . "
0,"Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . "
0,"Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? "
0,"But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . "
0,How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 
0,There are four more stops . 
0,"What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! "
0,Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 
0,"No , not on the train , but in the station . "
0,Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? 
0,"Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? "
0,"Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . "
0,I guess you'll never forget today . 
1,This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?

0,Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
0,I know it is . I don't know how it happened .

0,Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . 
0,"Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ? "
0,"I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . "

0,"That ' s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ' s education . I can ' t afford that by myself . "

1,"It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I'd estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.

I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father's business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.

After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?"
1,"Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family.
However, now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened. I feel like I cannot trust him. Without trust, I cannot stay in this relationship. On the other hand, I do not want my children to get hurt. I'm not sure how to move forward?"
1,I need to get on base to see my doctor. My ID card was in my wallet which was stolen. I'm unable to reach my husband at this time. He is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor. Is there anything I can do?
1,"My dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties, dinners, etc. Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down. My mom and everyone else behaves likewise. For my father who heads a company, this is normal. He has to be right all the time. He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle. 

Recently however, it's been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind. It isn't possible for me to get professional one-on-one help. He tells me to grow a pair and get over it. I recently have been developing more severe body image and self-confidence issues, which I have had all my life. I feel invalidated by my dad.  I have been more paranoid lately as well. I can't turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident. He makes me feel guilty about it.  I feel rather worthless more often than not, unfortunately.  What do I do?"
1,"Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. 

I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. 

What can I do?"
1,"I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. 
Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?"
1,We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together. I need some help to save our family.
1,"I'm in a relationship, but I feel like I'm always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated. My ex told me that I will never find anyone else, and that's lingering in the back of my mind."
1,"My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching.  When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off."
1,"I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband's ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend.  They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter's pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn't discuss my stepdaughter's matters with him.

The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone's frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter's birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn't let me have her. In my eyes, it's the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter."
1,"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It's like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.

Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He's been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too. 

I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I'm so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He's such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.

I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.

Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do."
1,"I use to be so happy. No matter what, I always was happy. I got into a relationship with this guy. I love him so much. We're both teenagers. The week after his birthday, my mom made me stop talking to him. It broke me. He came to my house and talked to her, and she let us date again but not see each other. He comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that I have to lie to her."
1,"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there's a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself."
1,"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We're going through a breakup, and I have nobody."
1,"Back in high school, my friend and I used to masturbate around each other. I hate even talking about it now because it's so weird. We didn't even realize how messed up it was at the time. One time, it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other. It wasn't supposed to be a gay thing, but it sure sounds like it now that I talk about it. I pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again. I'm having a lot of trouble."
1,"I have an eating disorder of binging. I've had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist."
1,"My husband doesn't trust me for some past we had. I know all marriages have their ups and downs, but sometimes, I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over: that I am messing around, which I am not."
1,"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they're gone, I feel sad. It's been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent."
1,"I feel that I am struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and it is making my day-to-day life extremely difficult."
1,"I never get infections or scars or anything, and it doesn't bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something, but I'm concerned."
1,"I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week. A month and a half later, I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair. I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment. I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay; a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. However, I still don't feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and I have days where I feel a zombie-like haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything. Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine?"
1,"I don't know what's with me. I'm almost constantly angry. Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. It's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline."
1,I'm feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just don't feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.
1,"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?"
1,"I'm depressed. I have been for years. I hide it from everyone because I'm scared of the reactions I'll get. Last time I tried telling my parents, it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed (I'm a legal adult), calling me ungrateful, and telling me that if I can't handle things now, it's only going to get worse in the future (which is turning out to be true). It's exhausting pretending to be okay, and I don't know how much longer I can try. I'm just really tired, and sadly, I can't afford the help I need on my own."
1,"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids' life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She's like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea."
1,"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.

One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me."
1,How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?
1,"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself."
1,"I'm a little paranoid. My mind does get the best of me. One night, I put chairs under all of my door knobs because I thought someone might break in. I also think a lot, which is probably the reason for the paranoia. I can't stand loud noises, like the sound of cars going by. The grocery store is too noisy, and I feel like people are looking at me."
1,"He is verbally abusive. When he gets mad, he just yells at me. At times, I feel scared."
1,"I have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that I talk to nowadays. I keep imagining having sex with them. I have never had sex before, nor have I had a boyfriend. I feel lonely and empty. I feel like my body is not okay, and I am missing something. I talk to so many boys in school, and I always fantasize about half of them. I want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time, I am busy thinking about sex."
1,"I feel like I am internally screaming all the time. Externally, I am calm, but I have this intense, unidentifiable emotion constantly. I don't feel sad. I don't cry a lot. I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming. It kind of feels like I'm a caged animal."
1,"As I was growing up, my mother and father always fought. With that, I grew trust issues. I think it's going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then I want to. I try not to let it affect me, but I can't."
1,"I feel so irritated and frustrated because of it. I get so angry to the point that I feel like I'm going to explode. I feel pathetic, stupid, and worthless. I just can't take this anymore."
1,I just need to know if I'm really crazy or not.
1,I get angry and act out. It scares my wife and child.
1,"We don't have sex a lot. I cheat when we argue. I don't kiss or have unprotected sex with them. It's a one time thing, and I never see them twice."
1,"My mother and I have an okay relationship. I know she loves me unconditionally, and I love her the same. However, more times than not, I'm afraid to tell her anything personal because she either doesn't listen, she turns it around and makes everything about her, or she ignores things - even when they are about my mental health."
1,"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?"
1,"There are intimate things she did early in the relationship, and things she had once agreed to try that she will not do now. I end up thinking about it all day. I feel rejected and think I married the wrong person."
1,"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I'm afraid it's going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal."
1,"I have four children. One of them is in her 20s, and she cannot afford to go, nor can I pay for her. She went last year for two weeks by herself."
1,"Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I'm the one who steps in. I'm the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I'm fighting for. I'm only in my early 20s."
1,"I've only been married three months. Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse."
1,"I was in a car accident and totaled my car. I gave up my job of nine years to pursue school full-time to better myself. I failed a class, and my boyfriend that I live with thinks I'm stupid and wants to break up with me. I have nowhere to go, and I feel like I'm losing everything."
1,"My dad is doing some really bad drugs, and I'm not allowed to see him anymore because of what he can do to me or my siblings on this drug. It has affected me tremendously in my life. It's even caused me anger and stress."
1,My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia. I have been dealing with that all day. My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said.
1,"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She's always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I'm always crying in my room."
1,"I'm trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?"
1,"I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I wouldn't make her daddy die."
1,"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances."
1,"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much."
1,"I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act? I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out."
