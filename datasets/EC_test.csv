1,Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.
1,Did you suffer any injuries?
1,No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.
1,Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.
1,I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.
1,Well_comma_ can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places
0,Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
0,Oh my goodness_comma_ that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?
1,Yeah he was punished hes in jail still
1,I there_comma_ dont know what to do_comma_ jst broke up with my girlfirned_comma_ we were 8 years together
1,sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
1,Yes we decided together with our minds_comma_ and know i come home and feel so distant from the world
1,sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.
0,I couldn't wait to go to the concert.
0,The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go_comma_ but somehow we did!!!
0,Wow_comma_ that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.
1,I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors
1,Ugh_comma_ those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? 
1,she was born premature at home_comma_ she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying
1,Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. 
1,yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors
1,so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up
0,That is nice of you. What did you do?
1,i was singing nursery songs :)
0,If you happy and you know it :)
1,my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon
0,He will_comma_ I have faith.
1,No problem. What kind of work does he do?
0,he is an armed guard
1,i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods! 
1,Thats not good. Do you own a gun?
1,I do! I want to be able to protect my son
1,That is always number one goal.
0,i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years
0,3 years is a long time. How come?
0,I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry
0,Oh I see. They must miss you_comma_ too.
1,I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident
1,Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.
1,Yes. I do not have a Facebook.
1,Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast_comma_ even when expressing your opinions.
1,So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised_comma_ and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer
1,Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed_comma_ such a terrible feeling!
1,Yes I do not like walmart.
1,Yes_comma_ i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US_comma_ the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed
1,My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married_comma_ and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!
1,Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?
1,I struggled with it_comma_ but my friend was in a really bad spot_comma_ with no income and raising her grandchild_comma_ he was the financial supporter. So_comma_ I didn't tell her_comma_ as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways_comma_ plus she really loves him!
0,my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house
0,I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted_comma_ lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. 
0,i totally agree with you!
0,That's a full time job raising a human
1,hi_comma_ i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country
1,Oh_comma_ I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?
0,i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms
0,That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself_comma_ but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!
1,I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home_comma_ he grabbed a game and sat on it_comma_ instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me_comma_ especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.
1,oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids
1,Me either! I have two of my own children_comma_ and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!
1,yes_comma_ i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense
1,I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died
1,Ugh I hate bugs with a passion_comma_ they are so creepy
0,I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well_comma_ and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.
0,Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!
1,Yes_comma_ they ended somewhat well_comma_ but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well_comma_ but I miss her.
0,I understand that_comma_ I hope things work out well for you both in the end!
0,Thank you! That means a lot.
0,One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.
0,That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.
0,Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for_comma_ and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.
0,Yes_comma_ I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.
0,Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!
0,I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.
0,Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.
0,Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.
0,Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend
0,Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?
0,My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be 
0,Oh wow_comma_ that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted.
0,Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you
0,I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me_comma_ but it always seems to be spot on.
0,I agree_comma_ someimes we just know
0,"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right_comma_ it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led_comma_ even if you might not fully know to where."
0,exactly_comma_ i get that entirely!
0,I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! 
0,That's great! How did they surprise you?
0,I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there
0,That is so sweet of them_comma_ I hope you enjoyed it!
1,I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely
1,Awww_comma_ That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely.
0,Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes
0,Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.
0,As silly as it sounds_comma_ I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.
1,Yeah that is always odd to me_comma_ before they can talk they are already unique!
0,One was pacifier_comma_ one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep_comma_ one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier_comma_ one liked cocooning in a sling!
1,That is how it goes_comma_ sometimes you can just figure them out immediately
1,The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.
1,I understand that one_comma_they are my favorite place to eat
1,Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.
1,That has happened to me too many times to count
0,I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family
0,That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.
0,Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him 
0,Uau_comma_ what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.
0,My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older_comma_ it will get better!
0,I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.
0,That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh_comma_ my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?
1,Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. 
0,But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!
1,I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others_comma_ but that doesn't make me feel any better.
1,Where you not secure in your self?
1,Well_comma_ like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately_comma_ she was. As an adult of course_comma_ my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!
1,You can track her down to say sorry_comma_ or would that be creepy?
1,"Unfortunately_comma_ she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out_comma_ and her brother and I ""friended"" one another."
1,Wow_comma_ so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?
0,I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.
0,Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?
0,That's a very kind statement_comma_ and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm_comma_ not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?
0,I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. 
0,That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself_comma_ and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?
0,Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.
0,My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!
0,It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?
1,It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often_comma_ even though we live 30 minutes away.
0,That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!
0,Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!
0,Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!
0,Wow_comma_ that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!
0,Ah_comma_ it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!
0,"My first thought was ""California"" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way_comma_ that's an amazing destination!"
0,We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)
0,Oh_comma_ wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!
0,I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.
1,I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? 
1,She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.
0,That's a real bummer_comma_ but as they say_comma_ there are plenty of fish in the sea!
1,I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.
1,I feel the same way.
1,How do you channel the anger? Obviously_comma_ it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!
1,I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.
1,Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)
1,One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.
1,Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?
1,She was around 11_comma_ so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school_comma_ as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.
1,Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!
0,I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!
0,ooo they are gonna love it_comma_ just its expensive_comma_ I remember when it was only $20 to get in.
0,Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson_comma_ and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!
0,Which one are you going to California or Florida ?
0,California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original_comma_ while adding lots of new attractions.
0,I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.
0,Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?
0,We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.
1,Yeah_comma_ I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?
0,Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!
1,I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? 
0,Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.  
1,My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.
1,I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.
1,Well_comma_ sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails
1,It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation_comma_ how do you ensure communication?
1,Text and emails are still the best option._comma_ until a nw way is created.
1,I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.
1,Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?
1,I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.
1,Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again_comma_ you can try to approach the topic from another angle.
0,I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas_comma_ my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!
0,Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?
0,From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!
0,That must have been quite the culture shock_comma_ glad it all worked out though!
1,One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.
1,I know_comma_ that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.
1,That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person_comma_ though_comma_ that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.
1,Yea for sure_comma_ I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? 
1,Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.
1,I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?
1,Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess
1,I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.
1,There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time_comma_ simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!
1,What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!
1,Yes_comma_ she lived several house back and she didn't know me_comma_ until after she did that! She knew me then_comma_ but after I talked to her_comma_ she apologized to both of us. 
1,Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!
0,Too often_comma_ it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.
0,I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?
0,Happily_comma_ I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves_comma_ you know?
0,Yes_comma_ we should try to yourself heathy
0,Every time I look through older photos of my children_comma_ I'm taken right back to the time they were that size_comma_ and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling_comma_ for sure.
0,Oh_comma_ it sure is_comma_ I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! 
1,Are your kids adults now?
0,One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.
1,I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you_comma_ but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!
0,I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!
0,I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!
0,I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.
0,It would be hard to replicate that day for sure_comma_ but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!
1,"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times_comma_ since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income."
0,I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. 
0,We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed_comma_ right there.
0,Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. 
0,I am sorry_comma_ because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.
1,I met up with an old flame recently_comma_ didn't go how I expected
1,Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued
0,Well_comma_ right after she gave me a big hug_comma_ she introduced me to her new boyfriend.
1,Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? 
1,I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy_comma_ but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.
0,My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!
0,OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
0,We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida_comma_ about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!
0,PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit_comma_ go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!
1,I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.
1,Well_comma_ we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it_comma_ she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!
1,Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
1,Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!
1,Did he do anything to you and your mom?
1,Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!
1,I am glad that nothing happened.
1,Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.
1,No_comma_ you didn't tell me! What happened?
1,She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out_comma_ she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!
1,Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much_comma_ you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.
0,Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party! 
0,Well_comma_ I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish_comma_ so I had... well too many.
1,Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?
1,Well first of all_comma_ it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT! 
1,Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?
1,You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...
0,My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!
0,Recently_comma_ my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts_comma_ it was very unexpected!
0,That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?
0,I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!
0,I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch_comma_ but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!
0,Oh what job was the interview for?
0,This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?
0,I think you got it man! Congratz!
1,"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?"
1,oh my  are you really serious?
1,As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots_comma_ and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building_comma_ and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us_comma_ and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!
1,I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary
1,I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me_comma_ as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!
1,Oh no_comma_ what did you do?
1,I quietly pushed him away_comma_ as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset_comma_ since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.
1,Did you ever tell your friend?  
1,This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it_comma_ and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!
1,Oh no_comma_ I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer
1,Yes_comma_ and of course we tried to call and have someone come out_comma_ but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!
1,I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. 
1,I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me_comma_ but I never told her about it. 
1,Wao_comma_ you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?
1,I felt bad_comma_ but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild_comma_ and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out_comma_ not to mention she really loves him.
1,SUper tough situation_comma_ i think you should let her know_comma_ and let her decides next
1,I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her_comma_ can you imagine my reaction to it?
1,Oh_comma_ I'm sure you were embarrassed! But_comma_ maybe you can laugh about it now?
1,Yes_comma_ totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth_comma_ didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching
1,Well_comma_ I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!
1,THe good thing about it_comma_ was the lady_comma_ she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to_comma_ no worries!
0,I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach_comma_ with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!
0,Ah_comma_ that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?
0,Well_comma_ we are staying at Panama City Beach_comma_ so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.
0,Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-))
0,I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer_comma_ and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!
0,Well_comma_ that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!
0,That_comma_ and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))
0,Yes_comma_ I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!
0,Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.
1,Okay_comma_ a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!
1,Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.
1,Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals_comma_ if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)
1,Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol
1,WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)
0,I came home_comma_ and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby_comma_ my heart speeded so fast!
0,oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
0,We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.
0,Yes_comma_ God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second
0,"I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings."
0,What kind of work do you do?
0,I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture_comma_ and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)
0,Actually I'm not_comma_ but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations_comma_ I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.
0,That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!
0,"I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from_comma_ that challenge them_comma_ and that in some ways could be considered ""better""."
0,I agree_comma_ its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas
0,"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity_comma_ if not failure!"
0,Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
0,I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago_comma_ and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)
0,Baby belugas are cute_comma_ but not as cute as your baby!
0,"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out_comma_ and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot""_comma_ the spunky little girl ant in the movie."
0,That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.
0,This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt
0,That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten_comma_ so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.
0,Yes_comma_ definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards 
0,Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing_comma_ I love it when my girls do that!
0,THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?
0,I am not sure_comma_ it was pretty random
0,Did they give you any feedback?
0,That is a shame_comma_ you need to learn from your mistakes.
0,So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.
0,That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!
0,I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July
0,Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.
0,Yes_comma_ they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting
1,Oh no_comma_ what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?
1,I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?
1,"Yes_comma_ I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one."
1,I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?
1,It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.
1,It was fantastic_comma_ a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things_comma_ but its a lot more grime and serious.
0,I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer_comma_ and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.
0,Did it go your way?
0,Yes_comma_ I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.
0,That is great - have you found another job yet?
0, Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job
1,Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!
1,I hate traffic too_comma_ it makes me angry
1,Yes! People were constantly cutting me off_comma_not signalling and slamming on their brakes
1,People are so rude when they drive these days
1,The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.
1,I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.
1,And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.
1,That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me_comma_ I was too curious to not see the others.
0,My best friend did amazing in school_comma_ despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.
0,She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.
0,She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.
0,That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!
0,I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.
1,Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.
1,Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
1,I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.
1,Oh_comma_ I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.
1,I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too. 
0,I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy_comma_ so I put the word out
0,Put what word ? You mean published the info?
0,Basically_comma_ yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!
0,So what breed did you get ?
0,When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan_comma_ which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them
0,I would be too! You did what you had to do!
0,Yes_comma_ I am always better off with them as my parents_comma_ they want to see us succeed
0,Do you find the home buying experience worth it?
0,Yes_comma_ it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.
0,How long do you plan on staying in that house?
0,Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married
0,Well that's awesome! I'm happy for you!
1,My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200_comma_000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.
1,You shouldn't_comma_ because that is  a very stressful job
0,Yeah_comma_ that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance_comma_ and is on call a lot.
0,And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery
1,True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.
0,I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future
1,Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.
0,I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path
0,That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!
1,That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?
1,I'm not sure. What would you do?
1,You could chat to them and complain!
1,Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?
1,Who knows_comma_ I guess it depends on how reasonable they are. 
0,One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at_comma_ my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.
0,Oh no_comma_ that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?
0,I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.
0,So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate
0,She also has 2 daughters_comma_ 2 and 7_comma_ and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.
0,I love that. Lots of new friends_comma_ haha
0,I've known them since the moment they were born_comma_ but it will still be a blast.
0,Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood
0,I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?
0,I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era
1,Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.
1,The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.
1,Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.
1,Oh no_comma_ it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends_comma_ food_comma_ toys_comma_ tv shows_comma_ etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.
0,Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!
1,How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.
0,Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.
1,I hate bullies. Playground or politics_comma_ I find them intolerable.
1,Me too_comma_ bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.
1,Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?
1,Well_comma_ I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.
0,I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.
0,I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.
1,Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.
1,Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it_comma_
1,My parents keep taking my money
1,That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??
1,They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.
1,Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts_comma_ so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5_comma_ $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.
1,"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!"
1,"LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the "" You are an adult not a child"" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed_comma_ then you have to deal with the consequences. "
1,LOL! Okay_comma_ y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes_comma_ I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)
1,Okay_comma_ it wasn't just one_comma_ it was three: One cherry_comma_ and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh_comma_ the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like_comma_ I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids_comma_ I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would_comma_ but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now_comma_ lol
1,The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.
1,Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?
1,She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up_comma_ she slipped.
1,That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. 
1,It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it_comma_ but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.
1,That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way. 
1,It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.
1,I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...
0,A few years ago_comma_ there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time. 
0,Did you not have a car? That's hard. I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.
0,We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!
0,That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.
0,Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind. 
0,It's incredible_comma_ and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.
0,Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.
0,Yes.My first was when i turned 18.
0,That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year. 
1,LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??
1,Haha! Yes! And what's really funny_comma_ is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops. 
1,It was raining hard one night and the power shut off
1,Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?
1,Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles 
1,Well atleast you have something to help you guys.
1,One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.
0,I ended up actually getting a 98%!
0,That is great! My B.S. ( I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology) is in Psychology.
0,Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.
1,Do you have any pets?
1,Pet? Like dogs and other?
1,Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff. 
1,Wow_comma_ seriously I hate those pets being around me
0,Congrats _comma_that's a step forward
1,One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.
1,I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.
1,I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.
1,That must have been really hard. 
0,It was_comma_ but I grew so much from it_comma_ and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.
0,I know this guy who is so young_comma_ yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.
0,Really?  What kind of work does he do?
0,He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.
0,Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
1,I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really_comma_ really not.
1,Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
1,"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk.."
1,Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?
0,No_comma_ they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.
0,Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
0,Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?
0,All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
1,Yeah_comma_ I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..
1,I know what you mean.  However_comma_ the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.
0,lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger_comma_ but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)
1,I was just thinking about how a few years ago_comma_ we lost our cat.
1,Oh no!  What happened to it?
1,It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(
1,So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.
1,Thank you. I appreciate that. 
1,I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.
1,it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying 
1,The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha
1,Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient 
1,Agreed_comma_ definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.
1,Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends_comma_ so gross.
1,Did you get sick afterwards 
1,Extremely_comma_ but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish_comma_ unless sushi because they properly prepare it
1,i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food
1,You don't care for sushi that much?
1,I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!
0,Damn that sounds like a pretty good one! How did that turn out?
0,I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!
1,That's how all pranks should be!
1,My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.
1,I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
1,I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.
0,Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. 
0,I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.
0,I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think_comma_ if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! 
1,We have dogs and chameleons together_comma_ so it's like we're already a little family haha
0,Aw_comma_ that's sweet! I really am hoping y'all make it through this together. (:
1,I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.
1,So sad_comma_you can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you.
1,I hope so. Maybe one day_comma_ but I am not so sure.
1,Don't give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.
0,I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.
0,Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?
0,I think she has expressed interest in me in the past_comma_ but she recently moved_comma_ but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.
0,That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her
0,I am very lucky_comma_ my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?
0,Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant_comma_ it was great. What about yours_comma_ what makes your friends so great too?
0,Wow_comma_ I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!
1,I wish my friends bought me alcohol_comma_ that would make for a hell of a night! 
1,For sure_comma_ maybe you need new friends!
1,I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.
1,That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother 
1,I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.
1,Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?
1,Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt_comma_ though.
1,That is not good at all. That is a very scary situation.
0,Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?
0,I have not tried yet_comma_ but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight
0,Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha
0,I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So_comma_ i think i am passing on that
0,I live in Louisiana_comma_ so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.
0,I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me_comma_ even to this day.
0,You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?
0,I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.
0,You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.
1,You know_comma_ that is tough_comma_ but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?
1,Nothing went wrong_comma_ we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then.
1,But you failed the exam? Did you revise?
1,I did not revise. Sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected.
1,At least you know for next time eh?
0,My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.
0,That is great that you have an awesome Mom!
0,She's amazing. Do you love your mom?
0,Yes I do love my mom very much.
1,I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.
1,ooh_comma_ am so sorry about that. Have you tried to talk to her?
1,It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month_comma_ so I will likely discuss it when she returns.
1,that will help you know her stand on your relationship
1,That sounds tough. What do you do/
1,well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.
0,That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.
0,it pays decent and feeds the kids so I can't complain.
0,"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back"""
0,I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.
0,That's awesome. What are you majoring in?
1,Environmental engineering! I enjoy it_comma_ but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.
0,Sometimes it's good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it.
1,I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear. 
1,That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?
1,I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.
1,I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. 
1,I've been telling myself that for years_comma_ I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?
1,I like scary movies as well so I know how addicting they can be.
1,What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?
1,Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.
1,"Oh yeah_comma_ Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. I'm actually a Christian and a conservative but I'm appalled that everyone on the ""right"" have fallen for this guy. He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be."
1,I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him_comma_ too.
1,Yeah_comma_ I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. 
0,I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida
0,awwww. congratulations. what is your major
0,Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.
0,lovely. thats really great. wishing you all the best
0,I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.
0,That is interesting_comma_ how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?
0,He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.
0,I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.
0,Do you like to go through old family pictures?
0,Yes_comma_ I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?
0,Absolutely. I love to hear my mámá tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.
0,That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.
0,I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.
1,I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.
1,:( I'm very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.
1,I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.
1,I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that_comma_ but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try
1,I'm not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?
1,Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? I told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha.
0,Now that is an interesting perspective!
0,My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.
0,That is really nice of her.  It is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes.
0,Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!
1,Yes.  Too many people these days are mean to one another!
1,My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.
1,That's so sad_comma_ I hope you've gotten over it.
1,It is tough_comma_ but I think I will make it.
1,That's good_comma_ death is a natural part of life.
0,My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!
1,No_comma_u don't have to be 
1,It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.
1,Yes_comma_u will surely get over it
0,I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.
0,That is very special and I am so happy for you.
0,I am very happy_comma_ too. Do you have someone special in your life?
0,Yes_comma_ married for 15 years and it is still great.

So_comma_ I ran towards where the parents were seated_comma_ stopped when I turned the corner_comma_ and walked calmly over to my mom_comma_ taking a seat on her lap.

0,When you have responsibilities that you really care about_comma_ you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family_comma_

0,I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better

1,I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.
1,How awful! how do you feel about it?
1,Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.
1,Yes I understand_comma_ it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought.
1,I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.
1,Lols why didn't you do anything

1,I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?
1,Yes_comma_ I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.
1,Ah! That's quite understandable. It is tricky at first and non-intuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot. 
1,every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.
1,I know it's hard_comma_ but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!
0,I still can't believe my life is where it's at_comma_ especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.
0,Why what is the matter?
0,Well_comma_ for many years I was an alcoholic_comma_ working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!

1,Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?
1,Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.
1,Yeah_comma_ in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.
1,Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that. 
0,Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?

0,I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class
0,Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.
0,So about a year ago now_comma_ my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!
0,Oh wow_comma_ puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?
0,Yes_comma_ so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd! 
0,Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one_comma_ they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?
1,There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me_comma_ but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.

0,I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!
0,that's great! i hate when people cheat
1,There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.
1,I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone_comma_ wondering if she'd show up. At least_comma_ it sounds like_comma_ she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?
1,Yes_comma_ she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!
1,That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour_comma_ and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out_comma_ but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.
0,I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!

1,Actually that has happened to me_comma_ during Thanksgiving
1,Yes_comma_ when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous_comma_ and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.
1,Im from NC mountains_comma_ it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast
1,It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.
1,That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice_comma_ but to keep going_comma_ bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.
1,When my parents got divorced when I was a kid_comma_ it was one of the hardest things for me.
1,I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.

1,That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?
1,Well_comma_ when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!
0,That's good to hear.  How was the beach?
1,There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.

0,They must have been really happy.
0,Sometimes one gives priority to work
0,The world is very beautiful
0,There are so many spectacular views on this planet
0,Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice
0,It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.
0,People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life
1,I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.
1,That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people
1,Well_comma_ it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself_comma_ is it?
1,No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.
1,As a kid_comma_ I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.
1,Oh_comma_ wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie_comma_ and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?
1,That's the thing -- NO! I mean_comma_ there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!
1,Aw_comma_ poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or_comma_ are you still afraid of them?
1,"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future_comma_ right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason_comma_ it worked a charm ;-)"
1,Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow_comma_ what a cool thing to say!  
1,I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated_comma_ really.
1,We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?
1,Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*_comma_ it's really about the person and where they're at.
1,I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.
1,"I do look at that as a strength_comma_ in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake."""
0,I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!
0,That is pretty awesome_comma_ I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.
0,I highly_comma_ highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.

1,It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!
1,Yeah_comma_ that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.
1,Yes! They cut in front_comma_ and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it 
1,Yeah_comma_ everyone just seems miserable_comma_ so it kind of drags you down_comma_ too. But it's a necessary evil.
1,I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible

1,Forget him. Get yourself a real man.
1,no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes

1,When I was younger_comma_ I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive_comma_ because i didn't want to get into an accident.

0,Do you cook a lot with tomatoes
1,I do yes! and since the method i used is working_comma_ i have tons of tomatoes!

1,People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.
1,Yes_comma_ exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!
1,That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.
0,A few years ago_comma_ I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other_comma_ so we met up in person!
0,I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.

0,I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.
0,My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!
0,That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.
0,She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.
0,Yea_comma_ experience and skills matter a lot more.
1,I walked my dog outside_comma_ and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.
1,I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.
1,Yeah...Even though I take her outside_comma_ 10 minutes later_comma_ she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?
1,I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.
1,I think being with my husband makes me a better person
0,That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?
0,Definetly_comma_ he's my best friend forever.
1,I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.

1,So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?

0,Well the party was for me_comma_ hahaha they really got me on that one!
1,Oh_comma_ I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So_comma_ you like surprise parties then? I never did.
1,Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.
1,What kinds of things are you talking about?
1,Owed money to my mother in law for something_comma_ $15_comma_ she reminded me in a less then nice way.
1,That's not very fair_comma_ a kind reminder could've gone a long way.
1,Exactly_comma_ especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.

1,That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!
1,Yea_comma_ he had eaten to much sugar and well_comma_ it didn't end well

1,That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.

0,My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today_comma_ one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile

1,That is no fun_comma_ you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time
1,Yeah_comma_ and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking_comma_ but at least should have gotten a chuckle.
1,Well there is always next time!
1,My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.
0,you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!
0,That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me_comma_ I should look into that.

1,What type of dog is it?
1,A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically_comma_ but this one is just terrible.
1,I get that_comma_ some are just not well trained at all
1,This morning my husband received a call_comma_ he got nervous_comma_ I think it was a woman ... difficult

1,he hit him and said a bad word
1,When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying 
1,Man_comma_ that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.

1,What will you do with it now?
1,You know_comma_ I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.
1,Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor. 
1,That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning_comma_ too. That's too bad.
1,I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road_comma_ and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.
0,I did! His name is Alphy.

0,Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.

1,lol I didn't tell her...Should i?
1,Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol
1,Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.
1,That's sucks. Does the culprit know?
1,Yeah_comma_ that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.
1,That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?
0,I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!
0,I've never been_comma_ so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.

0,Nice! How old is your nephew?
0,11_comma_ he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.
0,That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.
1,I lost something of my mother in laws the other day_comma_ I feel so bad.
1,That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?
1,I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear_comma_ it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!
1,At least those things come in sets_comma_ so you can keep part of it?
0,I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award
0,It is a work award or something?
0,Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for
0,I am sure you are going to get it.
0,I appreciate that. Thank you
0,Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive_comma_ but it sounds like a good opportunity.
0,No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.
0,THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.
1,I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!
1,I know what you mean. Did you get the job?
0,I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?
1,I have not. What is it?
0,It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me_comma_ that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!
1,I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.
1,There are some bad parents out there_comma_ that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?
1,It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.
1,Lol_comma_ that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...
1,I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.
1,That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?
1,Well_comma_ for the most part it's my family. My husband_comma_ kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!
1,Don't worry_comma_ it will get better. I know you deserve better
0,My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.
0,I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her_comma_ so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom.
0,Yeah_comma_ luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.
0,That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.
0,I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.
0,I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.
0,I've never been to California.
1,I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend_comma_ and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.
1,That must of been terrible.
1,It WAS. Since she was wet_comma_ the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.
0,Been having a good day_comma_ relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.
0,You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!
0,Yeah_comma_ it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.
0,Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!
1,I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.
1,Was it on the phone or in person?
1,It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room_comma_ then we took a lab tour afterwards.
1,What are you referring to?
0,yes my behavior refereed to people
1,you're welcome_comma_ but for what?
0,i am going to garden
0,Cool. Thats a fun hobby.
0,Well habe fun I guess.
1,It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake
1,placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it_comma_ so they gave me something else without telling me
1,Oh_comma_ that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on. 
1,Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen
1,No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!
0,yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok
0,it made me proud he was my rep
0,the president represented us at this association
0,Aha. What was the association?
1,It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.
1,I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.
1,I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.
1,That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?
0,About an hour. But it'll be worth it.
0,It must be very good_comma_ if you're willing to go that far!
0,I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.
0,Wow_comma_ you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?
0,Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.
0,Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?
0,I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.
1,It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up_comma_ go to work_comma_ etc. but I was wrong about that!
0,Was it recently? Happy Birthday
0,Yes_comma_ last week. Thank you!
0,It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now
0,Oh goodness_comma_ what happened for the past 3 weeks?
0,She went to visit her family
0,Oh_comma_ I was thinking something bad happened.
1,It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother
1,Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. 
1,Thank you for your solidarity
1,Take care of yourself and your family.
1,We knew she was pregnant_comma_ but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!
0,I am sure it will be fine_comma_ do you have a preference
0,Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met
0,I am happy for you then
0,Even though there are plenty of flirts around_comma_ I remain loyal to my wife.
0,That is good_comma_ it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!
0,It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one_comma_ which was 5 years ago now.
1,Good for you! I wish more people were like this_comma_ unlike my ex! 
0,My friend got a new truck_comma_ I'm really envious of him.
1,You should channel that envy into motivation!
1,I agree_comma_ if I work hard I could buy that truck. 
0,Exactly_comma_ be positive and you can buy one for yourself!
1,I should_comma_ I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.
0,Hello_comma_ I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it
0,That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.
0,If I really like to be positive_comma_ despite the difficulties
0,I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!
0,so it is ... a big hug
1,I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu
1,oh poor thing_comma_ is she at least getting better?
1,It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol
0,haha that must be nice too though_comma_ you get your own alone time for the most part!
0,This morning and I saw a tree_comma_ I never detailed it_comma_ but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists
0,I see_comma_ you must have felt hopeful
0,I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties
0,Good_comma_ one should always be positive
0,thank you for your comments
0,Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful_comma_ I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed

0,she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl
0,that's right ... thanks for your comment
1,Hi_comma_ I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband_comma_ but I do not have the courage to tell him
1,That's a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later
1,Best of luck to you
0,I'm looking for a new job_comma_ and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.
0,There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately_comma_ especially technical support.
0,oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure 
1,My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here_comma_ so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.
0,It is an excellent opportunity_comma_ to know other people and places_comma_ to open up to the possibility_comma_ I assure you that it will go to you very well
1,I'm sure it is great for her_comma_ but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.
0,You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both
1,Hello_comma_ I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs_comma_ and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad
1,That sounds like it's rough_comma_ did your father accept your apology?
1,yes_comma_ but I feel like a cockroach
1,Well_comma_ I'm sure he understands_comma_ and you shouldn't feel too bad_comma_ as long as you apologized you're fine.
1,I'm supposed to be on a diet_comma_ but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.
1,it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you! 
1,But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(
1,hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days! 
0,my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!
0,He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby
0,I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does
1,I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.
1,I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. 
1,Ugh_comma_ that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.
1,My bedroom is first floor_comma_ and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol 
1,I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big_comma_ did i just leave it somewhere?
1,Did you retrace your steps
1,I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it
1,I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places I'd been to.  It worked for me then_comma_ found a G-shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet
0,I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited
0,that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?
0,no_comma_ with my little baby. they've never met my son_comma_ they can't wait
0,oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together
0,My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.
0,I would be too_comma_ that is a long time!
0,Yeah_comma_ it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.
0,Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
1,I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.
1,Wow did youcall someone about that?
1,No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.
1,Wow_comma_ that sucks_comma_ that is why I wanna live all alone!
1,Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!
1,my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing
1,Oh my_comma_ did they notice you farted?
1,she did_comma_ she didn't say anything but i know she heard it
1,Must have rather awkward. Remember_comma_ farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that.
1,My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends_comma_ and left me alone to fend for myself.
1,I am sorry_comma_ how have you been passing the time
1,Mostly been playing video games_comma_ but it's so boring without her.
0,I love video games_comma_ you should buy a switch!
0,Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not_comma_ the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth
0,that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
0,For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it
0,how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
0,for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible
0,this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .
0,condition the mind and spirit
0,i would totally attempt it 
1,I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.
1,I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it
1,yes_comma_ I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort 
1,that's good prayer can comfort_comma_ maybe you should talk to your pastor
1,I dont have a pastor_comma_ or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some. 
1,I had plans to move from Florida to California_comma_ but I'm starting to get cold feet...
0,Ooh_comma_ that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing_comma_ but I' one state above :)
1,Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.
0,I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision_comma_ and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like
0,today I think today is a day to learn_comma_ to hug_comma_ to smile_comma_ to make someone happy
1,Yes_comma_ realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way 
0,that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that_comma_ to my children I kiss them_comma_ my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something
0,Maybe thats a good idea_comma_ to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!
0,It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile
1,I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends_comma_ no husband_comma_ no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life
1,Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
1,not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward
1,Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
0,My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!
0,I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.

0,that sounds like fun_comma_ where in the ozakrs?
0,Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river 
1,I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them_comma_ to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.
1,Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes
1,Yeah_comma_ it was weird_comma_ the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing_comma_ but she responded to me almost instantly every time.
1,Hm maybe she liked you ha
1,I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.
1,Free pizza is good! How did you get it?
1,The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl_comma_ who was brand new_comma_ didn't know so she just didn't charge me.
1,Well_comma_ I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.
0,It was fine how about you?
0,yeah good. whats your name?
1,I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.
0,oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend
1,hello how was your day?
1,My day was great so far!  How about you?
1,That is good to hear!  I'm am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!
1,yeah nice to talk to you.
1,I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But_comma_ no was there to spot it. But_comma_ when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At_comma_ that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.
1,Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?
1,My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.
1,Ah. Well_comma_ chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!
0,I went for a job interview_comma_ and it seemed to go pretty well.
0,That's great! When will you find out?
1,It should be a couple weeks_comma_ assuming they go at the pace they said they would.
0,Good luck! I hope you get it.
1,I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.
1,I know how it feels to be homesick_comma_ but you have to put your wife first.
1,Yeah_comma_ definitely_comma_ that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people_comma_ so it can be tough.
1,You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.
1,I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.
1,Ohh man_comma_ that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?
1,Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.
1,I'm sorry.  Where did she go?
1,Germany for a language course.
1,I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.
1,What happened? Did someone bump on your car?
1,No_comma_ the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.
1,Be carefull _comma_ you don't know the cray people that is out there.
1,Yes_comma_ afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.
1,I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.
1,That must have been awkward.
1,Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off_comma_ but I sure felt stupid about it.
1,Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.
1,Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.
1,"I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment_comma_ and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates."
0,Nostalgia can be wonderful_comma_ can't it?
1,It can_comma_ but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore_comma_ but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.
1,I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music
1,Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.
1,My friend and her mom were fighting about money_comma_ and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.
1,sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight 
1,I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.

0,oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.
1,I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog_comma_ but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.
1,Thar was an embarasing moment for sure
1,Yeah_comma_ I don't like calling people out in general_comma_ don't know what made me think to do it this time.
1,Maybe you are felling lonely these days?
1,I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.
1,Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
1,I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.
1,Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.
0,My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.
1,What are you worrying about?
0,I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.
1,Well_comma_ I hope it's alright_comma_ heart problems is not something you should take lightly.
1,Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.
0,I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child. 
0,What is your favorite memory with your friends?

0,That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.
0,My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.

0,"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt. "
0,I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone_comma_ do whatever you please!
1,I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well_comma_ but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.
1,Oh man_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad_comma_ though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?
1,I'm just pretty embarrassed_comma_ I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.
1,Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!
1,I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.
0,I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?
0,You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.
0,Okay_comma_ I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.
1,I just got a puppy_comma_ but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.
1,That would be sad_comma_ do you keep him in a cage?
1,Fortunately_comma_ no. I let him run around the house_comma_ but I feel like he gets bored_comma_ so I keep the TV on for him.
1,That's nice_comma_ what does he enjoy watching?
1,Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.
1,Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?
1,If that is the case_comma_ I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain_comma_ then it is most definitely wrong.
1,I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!
1,My dog disappeared while I was away at college.
1,That's so sad_comma_ I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?
1,My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.
1,My goodness_comma_ that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.
1,Yes_comma_ I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.
0,I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!
1,Do you have some big plans for the visit?
1,Probably not_comma_ because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away_comma_ so she will be here when she has her baby. 
1,Uh oh_comma_ have you ever delivered a baby before?
1,Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors! 
0,Oh right_comma_ I am a doctor.
0,Oh cool! What kind of doctor?
0,I am a baby delivering doctor!
0,Oh wow_comma_ you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.
0,What was the accomplishment again?
0,My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort_comma_ and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.
0,Wow_comma_ that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?
0,I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home_comma_ and it made me reflect on my own life.
0,What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?

0,What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?
0,A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.
0,Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!
0,No_comma_ it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.
0,Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!
0,I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.
1,Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?
1,She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.
0,Please tell me who she is!!!!!
1,Sorry_comma_ I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.
0,Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend_comma_ time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!
1,I know exactly how you feel_comma_ I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.
1,Didn't the sun always shine back then_comma_ when we were happy and young and had money?!
0,Hahaha yes_comma_ you are so right. Then again_comma_ I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real_comma_ more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.
0,That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past_comma_ but the future will be bright_comma_ too.

1,Yes_comma_ my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.
1,What a story_comma_ it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.
1,I woke up this morning_comma_ and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.

1,You should install security cameras outside your house.

1,I am so sorry that happened to you!
1,I love my cat_comma_ but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.
1,Yuck_comma_ sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!
1,She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles. 
1,Well_comma_ at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.
0,I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!
0,Oh really?! Where you headed too?
0,We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to_comma_ and we will be seeing the ocean as well!
0,Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? 
1,I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.

1,Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.
1,I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.
1,Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.
1,Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be_comma_ so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting_comma_ I guess.
1,Well_comma_ a wise man said that having patience was a virtue_comma_ I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.
1,I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around_comma_ and people laughed at me.
1,I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say
1,That is good advice. I feel better about this.
1,Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know
0,I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.
0,That's great_comma_ how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.

0,She couldn't have been older than one!
0,Wow_comma_ that's awfully young for that kind of thing.
1,I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly_comma_ it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do_comma_ even though I put my best work and most effort into it.
1,Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere
1,It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.
1,Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated
1,That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!

0,I am in the same boat_comma_ but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. 
0,That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks

0,Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. 
0,That is so true. But to lead a happy life_comma_ money is necessary to some extent.
1,I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.
1,Why? How did that happen?
1,Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.

0,I know_comma_ right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid_comma_ made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line_comma_ never managed to do anything else.
0,We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! 
1,I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!
1,Maybe you could try to better that?
1,I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them
1,You could start a trend.
1,I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(
1,I know he will_comma_ i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky
1,I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.
1,That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.
1,Yeah_comma_ I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one_comma_ but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.

1,I just recently finished potty training my dog_comma_ that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.
1,Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!
1,I can imagine a rescue_comma_ generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get_comma_ can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!
1,For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!
0,My dog started looking really sick and in pain_comma_ but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet_comma_ so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.
0,THat is stressful.  Are they ok?

1,I heard that was a really fun game though!
1,I've had to help take care of others before as well.
1,Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.

0,I agree_comma_ I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.
0,Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.
1,I once went a restaurant_comma_ and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen! 
1,Did you say anything to someone?
1,I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out_comma_ how can a place like that operate!?
1,a Burger King near me got shut down for that!
0,Do any of your kids play any sports?
0,No_comma_ I do not have kids. Yours?
0,My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.
0,I bet you were really proud!
1,I was so late for work one day_comma_ I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!
1,Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.
1,I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on_comma_ I was so in shock_comma_ even the neighbors saw. It was bad.
1,Yeah_comma_ it sounds that way.
1,I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.
1,That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers_comma_ they are so slow sometimes.
1,The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.
1,Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy_comma_ especially during rush our!
0,I was so excited when I got my new puppy_comma_ it was awesome!
0,"Man_comma_ I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage_comma_ as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and ""new feelings"" going on as you watch it grow."
0,I agree with you_comma_ the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions_comma_ positive ones of course!
0,Yeah_comma_ but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy_comma_ so it's hard to keep up sometimes_comma_ but also fun!
1,Those were simpler times_comma_ I wish I could go back and relive those days!
0,Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.
1,Ah_comma_ I see. Had a great childhood_comma_ hu?
1,It was great_comma_ so much time running around outside without a care in the world.
0,I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child. 
0,Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?
0,My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest_comma_ was the one that released the most gas.
0,That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!

0,I know what that's like. I have three kids.
0,how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry

0,As I look at my 21 year old son_comma_ I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!

0,Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic

0,Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! 
0,I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s. 
0,I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.
0,Wow_comma_ that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. 
0,haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol
0,Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?
1,My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!
1,Wow_comma_ that sounds very disgusting.
1,It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.
0,I hope the baby rat is okay.
0,She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!

0,I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!

0,Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.
1,I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.
0,Oh that's nice_comma_ I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?
0,The cat appeared very relaxed_comma_ but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.
0,Well how nice_comma_ that must have been fun.
1,One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.
1,Wow that must have been scary!
1,If that wasn't frightening enough_comma_ I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!
1,How long were you lost for?

1,Wow back up there friend_comma_ what are you talking about?

1,Seriously what the hell are you talking about??

0,Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this_comma_ you never know what is going on behind the scenes_comma_ she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.
1,Yes_comma_ true_comma_ I know they tend to let bills go for things like that_comma_ which I don't do. 
1,I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead_comma_ you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.
0,I am so happy it's a boy
0,You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!

1,Hey_comma_ I just started the keto diet!
0,Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?
0,It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first_comma_ but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.
1,Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast_comma_ but putting in effort goes a long way.
1,Thank you_comma_ I wanted to be completely ready_comma_ so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.
0,Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy

0,I never liked milk growing up_comma_ because my family drank skim. 
0,Do you like it now?
0,Well_comma_ first I tried whole milk_comma_ and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk_comma_ and I like it!
0,I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!
0,I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.
0,No_comma_ but I am satisfied with my choice. 
0,That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.

1,Yes_comma_ well_comma_ it was just one of those things I know_comma_ but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.
1,Recently_comma_ I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.
1,Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?
1,It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.
1,Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.
1,On my recent vacation to Florida_comma_ there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!

1,dad caught me kissing my half aunt
1,Oh_comma_ wow... um_comma_ that's crazy. Why did you do that? 
1,I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her
1,I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad_comma_ haha.
1,You sound like a caveman
1,Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.
1,Why you no hunt and send wife instead.
1,Me miss BC. Me miss wife.
0,One of the scariest_comma_ yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.
0,Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it_comma_ it can get really scary
0,Oh_comma_ we were totally unprepared. In fact_comma_ my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!
0,You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys

0,Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works_comma_ but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman

0,Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting
1,When my dog passed away_comma_ I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.
1,That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?
1,She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough_comma_ I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.
1,That's really good_comma_ though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.
1,I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him
1,Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?
0,I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted
1,In that case_comma_ you are better off without her. 
0,My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs. 
1,Oh_comma_ wow_comma_ I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now
0,We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But_comma_ I know all parents aren't able to do that_comma_ or feel they shouldn't_comma_ so I can see both sides!
0,Well_comma_ I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that_comma_ the child should be able to manage
0,After a long few months of being a hermit_comma_ I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!
0,I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!

0,That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?

0,I'll have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.

1,Well whatever went wrong_comma_ I hope it can be fixed somehow.
1,A year ago_comma_ I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.
1,Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?
0,I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat_comma_ Muffin. 
0,Awe_comma_ that's a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!
0,I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all
0,That's great! Who did the travelling?
0,Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!
0,She must be a strong woman.
1,There was a storm the other day_comma_ close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it_comma_ so I was afraid and nervous!
1,Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.
1,Yes_comma_ it luckily passed our home_comma_ but you just never know!
0,That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!
0,My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend_comma_ I'm really happy for him. :)
0,Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.
0,Yeah_comma_ he gave her my grandmothers rings_comma_ since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money_comma_ but still wanted her to have something nice.
0,That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.
0,I can't wait to get a new car soon
0,That's exciting! What kind are you looking for?
0,I want a compact SUV_comma_ like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4
0,Ah. Hopefully something with good gas mileage!
1,not yet ready for the baby_comma_ need fix up his room
1,OK _comma_have you done the need full?
1,Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!
0,OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !
1,I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A_comma_ because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(
1,Oh I think I can guess which retailer you're talking about. I've had so many problems with them over the years
1,Yeah_comma_ it's horrible. I mean_comma_ what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address_comma_ you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.
1,I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense_comma_ it's just over the border!
1,she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap
1,Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).
1,It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it
1,Neither would I_comma_ I dislike such greedy people 
1,Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired
1,Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didn't cost too much.
1,It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again
1,I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!
1,For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies
1,I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?
1,Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!
1,Oh jeez that's really awful. Can you get it back?
1,At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it_comma_ that made me think differently
1,Well she had never done it before_comma_ so I thought it was special
0,I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant
0,Congrats you have a baby on the way
0,How many kids do you want in total?
1,My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business. 
1,Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?
1,I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.
1,Oh_comma_ sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?
1,I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him
1,The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.  
1,I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to
1,She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew
0,I know I will save the money I need for the baby
0,What is your plan to accomplish that? 
0,Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday
0,Just don't over do_comma_ you have to enjoy being a parent_comma_ that's a key to happy kids.
1,I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out
1,Kinda. I thought it was a secret 
1,i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.
1,Really? No shower for few days?
1,yes. homeless for a bit
1,i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye
1,i would feel terrible to thats really bad_comma_ you should just tell her and change! 
1,it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her
1,The truth can set us free_comma_ probably better for her and you both. 
1,i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.
1,Sorry to hear that... they say time heals everything but i disagree its been 9 years for me and it still feels like yesterday. How long for you? 
1,Im really sorry for your loss! I hope that someday it gets better for the both of us. 
0,i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist
0,Oh I love seeing kids achieve things! Adorable. Good for her! :) 
0,yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her
0,I am sure_comma_ I would be too of my daughter. You sound like an awesome parent. 
1,i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents
1,oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?
1,yeah_comma_ but still.. that feeling never went away
1,come clean to them about any major lies_comma_ you'll feel better :)
0,i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere
0,haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way
1,well_comma_ i guess women are more detail oriented
0,Amen sister! women always keep things in check
0,i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her
0,thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal
1,yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me_comma_ i escaped from there right awat
1,haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?
1,my dog passed away earlier this year
1,Oh no_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?
1,yeah.. but its too soon i feel
1,I understand_comma_ mine just turned 15 and I'm not looking forward to that day.
1,some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious
1,Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right. 
1,people are just selfish and only consider their own lives! 
1,soory it was mistakenly typed. 
1,I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!
0,That is pretty cool! What made you want to become a lawyer?
0,I played a video game when I was younger_comma_ called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_comma_ and it made me want to become one!
0,Great! I know it can be a tough job_comma_ I am sure you will do fine_comma_ keep studying!
1,once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life
0,Well there are plenty more girls out there
1,I fell down at work_comma_ and my khaki pants ripped open.
1,Oh no. Did you leave?
1,I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.
1,Like you had a different kind of accident lol
0,He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!
0,Honestly that sounds pretty fun to me I havent been to bingo in years. I love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins. 
1,Yes_comma_ and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.
0,it was fine. How about you?
0,yeah its an another good day
1,oh how was the climate there/
1,I managed to accidently flash a dozen people

0,yeah i do. i love her a lot
0,I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.
0,Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.
0,I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal_comma_ the sloth!
0,Oh thats great_comma_ what are the animals?
0,They have sloths_comma_ hippos_comma_ elephants_comma_ bears!
0,Oh wow_comma_ I love hippos and I don't know what sloth look like will let google help me out :)
1,I had a guest over that used my restroom_comma_ and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!
1,Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?
1,Maybe? Is it that big of a deal to you?
0,i have been more happy
0,Meaning you have been happier before or you are more happy now than you have been?
0,happier now beacuse i have been built a new house
0,Oh wow_comma_ that's great! I would be very happy too!
0,Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.
0,oh its hurts a little
0,I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal
1,i have watched races in tv
1,Me too! Have you ever been to one of them races?
1,nope iam a street racer
1,Oh cool_comma_ do you live in the city?

1,That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!
0,My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.
0,That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!
0,She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love)_comma_ but I wanted the upgraded version.
0,That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
0,I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.
0,That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!
0,I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.
0,That will come! The hardest part is over now!
1,The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off
1,The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
1,I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.
1,Ew_comma_ that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat.
1,I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.
1,I do not blame you!
0,I recently returned to my childhood home_comma_ and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.
0,that is awesome_comma_ i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home
0,Yes_comma_ it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?
1,I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone
0,That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. 
0,Yes_comma_ definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories_comma_ good times.
0,I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. 
1,We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience_comma_ but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car_comma_ so could just leave.
1,I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL_comma_ I know how you feel_comma_ only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!
0,Oh_comma_ you poor thing! Thankfully_comma_ we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?
1,Yeah you thought ahead_comma_ me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!
0,Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs_comma_ it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends_comma_ who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!
1,I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.
1,Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
1,It started off as a checkup_comma_ but then they requested additional testing.
1,Did everything go well or do you not know yet?
0,My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!
0,Oh man_comma_ I bet that is fun
0,Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?
0,No_comma_ I have always wanted one though
1,I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.
1,Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.
1,Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.
1,I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
1,I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me
1,Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time
1,I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing
1,Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
1,Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!
1,Wow! I would write a review_comma_ and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!
1,I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared_comma_ yet I am anxious.
0,Good luck! What is it on?
0,Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking. 
1,How much studying did you do leading up to it?
0,I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach_comma_ Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago_comma_ and we loved it!
0,Oh man_comma_ I bet that will be fun
0,We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?
0,I have_comma_ I love going when I can
0,One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!
0,That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?
0,We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!
0,Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?
0,It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?
1,That either sounds like a locket_comma_ or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?
0,Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top
1,Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.
1,I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.
1,I dropped my money while my hands were full_comma_ ran into the door_comma_ and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.
1,hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. 
1,I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party_comma_ I suspect he is going to see someone
0,What are you going to do about it
1,I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution
1,Well be careful for sure
0,My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.
1,I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?
1,I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?
1,Yes_comma_ you do.Otherwise_comma_ you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.
0,My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.
0,That is great that your hard work has paid off.
0,Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately_comma_ but mine finally came through at a good time!
0,Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!
0,Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.
1,I was on an airplane last week_comma_ and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things_comma_ but it really bothered me.
1,Dont worry_comma_ anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.
1,I tried to think about that_comma_ but I was still aggravated. On the plus side_comma_ at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.
1,Yeah thats important_comma_ did you have music you could have listened to or something?
1,I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.
0,Loyalty is a good thing
1,Yes_comma_ I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10_comma_000 more a year than my current business is paying though.
0,Oh wow_comma_ that is loyalty for sure
0,My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.
0,I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?
0,I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card_comma_ but she is living on a fixed income.
0,That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!
1,A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter_comma_ but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.
1,Wow_comma_ must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!
1,Thank you! We were rather frightened_comma_ and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.
1,I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.
0,Hello the plants in my garden I water them_comma_ I move the earth_comma_ I try to keep them happy
0,Especially when you feel something special by nature
0,Nature is a wonderful thing
0,I hope this feeling increases
0,My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.
0,Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?
0,We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.
0,I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?
1,Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows_comma_ but I can't really tell for sure.
0,Well I'm sure everything will go great!
1,Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!
1,yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
1,Yes_comma_ I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.
1,That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. 
1,Last week I had Thai food for lunch_comma_ and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work_comma_ and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say_comma_ the stench ended the workday a little early.
1,Oh wow_comma_ I have heard that can happen with that food
1,Yes_comma_ it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'
1,I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom_comma_ ever!
1,ewww! that is just super gross dude!
1,I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome_comma_ and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!
1,Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.
1,I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth_comma_ but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side_comma_ the 4k picture is astounding!
1,I would love to have that tv
1,Yes_comma_ I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?
1,Keep it_comma_ the guilt will go away
1,it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.
1,Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.
1,Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.
1,Exactly_comma_ sometimes I think women like drama.
0,I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.
0,It must have been fun to catch up with them.
0,it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now_comma_ so it was good to catchup.
0,Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.
0,I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.
0,Going to college is a good thing_comma_ but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.
0,Yes_comma_ exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance_comma_ two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!
0,That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
0,Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.
0,That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?
0,Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!
0,I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?
0,My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness
0,oh i know friends like those
0,I wish they did not suffer_comma_ because it is my suffering
1,Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.
1,Oh wow_comma_ sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?
1,By the time we noticed how bad it was_comma_ we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.
1,Did you have any damage to your home?
1,I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.
1,That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?
1,No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed
1,I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?
1,no it is an autoimmune disease
1,Hi_comma_ I'm separated_comma_ I'm hurt and my heart is broken
1,When did you get separated? By the way_comma_ that is terrible to hear.
1,one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel
1,Why are you so down_comma_ my depressed friend?
1,is that he loved her
1,This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.
1,Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?
1,Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.
1,Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!
1,I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly_comma_ though_comma_ and things have not been the same since.
1,I hate to hear that_comma_ what happened that made it end poorly?
1,We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.
1,maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.
1,If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work_comma_ but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!
1,You too_comma_ huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.
1,"Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol"
1,Nice idea_comma_ but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise_comma_ lol.
1,Well_comma_ you can at least try. 
1,I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!
1,You could get earplugs lol
1,I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes_comma_ but the suspense is killing me!
1,Oh man! What happened to your hip?
1,I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!
1,Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
1,From what I've read_comma_ unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?
1,If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks_comma_ it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..
1,Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.
0,Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it_comma_ botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!
1,The weather here feels kinda mild today_comma_ I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.
0,Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?
1,I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.
0,Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course
1,Writing speeches makes me nervous
1,I agree_comma_ the writing part is easy part_comma_ but the speaking part is the worst!
1,Yeah_comma_ it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience
1,Maybe so_comma_ they say to imagine the crowd naked_comma_ but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.
0,True_comma_ a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say
0,I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days_comma_ but they always bring back fond memories
1,Same. What are your favorites?
1,I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times_comma_ that and Harry Potter!
1,That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!
1,Yeah_comma_ sometimes there's more to those movies than you think_comma_ like they actually considered how adults would react
0,I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.
1,Yeah_comma_ maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything
1,Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.
0,Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life
1,Yeah I get that. Where did you work?
1,Dairy Queen_comma_ it was the only restaurant in my town
0,Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!
0,True_comma_ most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.
0,Yes _comma_ work is better with friends.
1,Yeah_comma_ so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard_comma_ it wasn't too busy either
0,Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.
0,Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day
0,Did you see that happen today?
0,Yeah_comma_ someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!
0,That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.
0,Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing
0,Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking
1,Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?
1,I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill
0,That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?
1,Yeah_comma_ usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things_comma_ but I decided to go for it_comma_ rolled on some grass to lose a little speed
1,When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks
1,Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm not good with confrontations
1,Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.
1,I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything_comma_ but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong
0,I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good_comma_ I didn't know I was doing *that* well!
0,Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!
0,Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.
0,How long have you been there?
0,I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?
0,I think I'm just going to move on.
0,My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!
0,Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?
0,Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries_comma_ but the rest - I should save it_comma_ my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.
0,That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.
0,If I had dispensible funds like that_comma_ there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it_comma_ but alas_comma_ priorites.  *lol*
0,I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!
0,Cool. Does that get a bonus?
0,I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*
0,I'm just happy to be recognized_comma_ especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.
0,Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.
0,I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.
1,So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.
1,"He kinda gave me the ""Mom_comma_ really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*"
1,I hate when that happens. 
1,I do_comma_ too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].
1,I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions
1,It's easier with a list but still_comma_ you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD
1,I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.
1,No_comma_ I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him_comma_ I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.
1,Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.
1,Multiple bags of chips_comma_ to be sure!  *chuckle*  
1,Or you can get a variety pack!
1,Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!
0,My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.
0,That's nice. I could get that here.
0,I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.
0,Yeah_comma_ I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.
0,I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!
0,Noice!  What was it about?
0,I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.
0,Very cool_comma_ are you a scientist?
0,Nope_comma_ just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.
1,I broke up with my boyfriend last week.
1,Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?
1,Well_comma_ I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online_comma_ the quiet is kinda loud.
0,I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.
0,Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up_comma_ I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.
0,I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!
0,Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?
0,I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL
0,That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!
0,This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel_comma_ it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!
0,I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!
0,I wish I could relate. I'm a male_comma_ so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through_comma_ and no matter what_comma_ mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?
0,15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful_comma_ as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?
0,Yeah_comma_ I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them_comma_ so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime_comma_ and they've given me lots of practice_comma_ but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19_comma_ that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.
0,Ah_comma_ make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)
1,Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is_comma_ it
0,It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  
1,Yes_comma_ that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!
1,It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. 
1,The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!
0,Wow_comma_ school is right around the corner
0,It is! We actually got everything they need and more_comma_ except for a few notebooks. 
0,Well that should relieve some stress
1,The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.
1,Everyone has those kinds of days_comma_ it happens
1,It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything_comma_ shelves_comma_ displays and even the door when I was leaving. 
1,I am sure they have forgotten about it
1,really didnt want to anything for days
1,Why not? What was wrong?
1,"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came_comma_ i had nothing to show for it""."
1,Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.
1,it is indeed. wont happen again though
0,"I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district""."
0,it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now
0,He must be a great speaker.
1,I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time
1,What are you saving for?
1,Baby is due in less than 3 months
0,I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.
1,I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me
0,I hope you did well on it.

0,Just hope for the best and don't worry.
0,I tried so hard for that exam_comma_ when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!

0,That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!
0,thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town
0,It sounds like you live in a great community.
1,I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this
1,Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!
1,Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym
1,Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! 
0,I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change
0,I understand that. I am the same way.
0,Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.
0,I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.
0,I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline 
0,Unfortunately_comma_ I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. 
0,I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing
1,the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls
1,Last week. we're in temporary housing now
1,Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.
1,I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!
1,It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this
1,I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.
1,That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations
1,I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.
1,Do you have plans to get together? 
0,Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.
0,How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.
1,I can't find another way to earn money
1,There are usually many ways_comma_ but it depends on what you want to do!
1,I just want to work from home
1,Well_comma_ we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us
0,I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now
0,That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare
1,You know_comma_ not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap
0,the buggy is important_comma_  I have a baby boy of my own.
1,I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials
0,Do you have a baby one the way?
1,I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back
1,do you make enough money to support the baby?
1,She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.
0,Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors 
1,I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding
1,Yes_comma_ you only hurt yourself when you get angry.
1,I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again
1,Give it some time_comma_ maybe she'll change her mind.
1,I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.
1,thats so sweet of you
1,She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.

1,I was so scared of going onto the train!
1,Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?
1,No but I hate going in objects that travel fast_comma_ I really did not want to go on it.

0,I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.
0,Interesting choice. Did she like it?
0,She loved it.  She's 17_comma_ I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.
0,That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.
0,I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed
0,So what is the problem exactly?
0,I just feel kinda stuck in life
0,Try doing something you never did before.
1,I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!
1,It is disgusting. What did you do?
1,I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.
1,You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.

1,I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.

1,I can imagine it is
1,I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.

1,Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town_comma_ I was a bit scared.
1,You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.
1,I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.
1,No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.
1,When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.
1,did you pay him back?
1,No_comma_ I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it_comma_ it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent_comma_ its been 17 years now.

1,I hear ya. Both sides are infected with this issue. 
1,Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?
1,Well_comma_ they are looking for more viewers. It is not news anymore_comma_ it is entertainment.
0,My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.
1,That is nice. They are good at that age. I have a 20-year-old_comma_ and he is currently ignoring me.
1,I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.

1,I thought walmart was pretty cheap.  I've never been to aldi's

0,Oh wow_comma_ that does sound fun
0,i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!

0,That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win
0,Well in those contests_comma_ you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables_comma_ it is very unlikely

0,yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..
0,Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.  Its good to find support and counseling too if you need it. Take care of yourself.
1,I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents
1,Yeah_comma_ i know that feeling. how did you handle it?

1,I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once

1,Can't say he did not deserve that..
0,I feel happy when I am outside in nature
0,That's wonderful!  I do too.  I don't take it for granted because I've been battling Lupus for 13 years and in bed a lot.  Its an amazing world we have! What is on of your favorite things to do outside?
0,I love to garden. Organic gardening_comma_ I plant peppers_comma_ cucumbers_comma_ tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies. 
0,Sounds wonderful!  I really want to take up gardening.  It would go with my new lifestyle I've adopted of eating plant based.  Do you have tips for a beginner?
0,Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt_comma_ You will soon catch on to what works for you. 
0,i was so in awe when i saw hamilton

0,Maybe i'll have to check it out
0,I took my daughter out to the skate park today.

0,I have anxiety attacks too_comma_  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.
1,yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off!
1,that is crazy_comma_  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down.
1,We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.
0,Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe
0,I found that out_comma_ after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly.
0,Its natural. Do not sweat it.
0,My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.
0,"That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the ""finish line"" first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?"
0,I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal_comma_ and I genuinely am pleased she did it!
0,See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!
1,I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.
0,I'm like that too_comma_ so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?
1,Yes_comma_ but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly_comma_ it was more about my own insecurities than about him_comma_ you know? As I grew more into myself_comma_ the jealousy loosened its hold.
0,I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself_comma_ those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!
0,My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.
0,Oh_comma_ that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.
0,I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.
0,That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!
1,I cosigned a loan with my son_comma_ expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.
1,wow.. what do you plan to do ?
1,I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money_comma_ but he wastes it.
1,yea i can understand that
1,I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!
1,Oh really? How did it go?
0,I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long. 
0,Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!
0,I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!
0,That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
0,Absolutely! Of course_comma_ now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah_comma_ so happy for her!
0,I bet! But at least now_comma_ like you said_comma_ she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!
1,I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.
1,Did that person betrayed you in any way?
1,"Well_comma_ in a sense. But to be fair_comma_ I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that_comma_ you know?"
0,Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.
0,I've definitely worked through that! Happily_comma_ it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)
0,I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!
0,I love reuniting with old friends_comma_ helps me remember and appreciate the good times.
0,I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.
1,I bet that was a long time ago!
0,In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.
0,I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.
0,I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.
0,Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. 
0,You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.
0,A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!
0,How did you meet your friend?!
0,She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.
0,College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!
1,I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately_comma_ and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.
1,That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.
1,Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.
0,I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.
0,Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate
1,I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.
1,Wait_comma_ were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.
1,"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man_comma_ SO tough."
1,It's like losing a family member :(
1,My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.
1,What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?
1,No_comma_ he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.
1,That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
1,I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs_comma_ my friends made it to 15. :(
1,How did they lose so much weight compared to you?
1,i guess they worked harder but
1,Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
0,I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping_comma_ too!
0,Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?
0,Yes_comma_ sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.
0,That sounds like a really relaxing time_comma_ I'm jealous.
1,We paid 600$ for a cruise_comma_ but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad
1,No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!
1,we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company_comma_ so they dont know what they're in for
1,I hope that you win your money back and then some_comma_ you really deserve it after all of that upset!
0,I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.
0,Lovely.  What did you do together?
0,We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.
0,Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>
1,I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.
1,That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!
0,I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.
0,Good deal!  Hopefully then you won't feel so alone!
1,I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!
1,That is frightening! especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?
0,I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.
0,Oh_comma_ so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job_comma_ hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!
0,I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family
1,Wait_comma_ summers already over? Next summer?
0,Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!
0,Oh really? I thought summer ended after July. You learn something new everyday lol
0,Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?
1,My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!
1,You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room_comma_ with a lock on it.
1,I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.
1,Yea man go for it_comma_ don't procrastinate.
1,I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.
1,Wow_comma_ that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(
1,My parents health has deteriorated rapidly_comma_ and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.
1,If my sister died to breast cancer_comma_ I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(
1,It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.
1,I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.
1,Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.
1,Life is not fair_comma_ but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with
1,Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that
0,I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!
0,What is the state and do you like change?
0,We've been great with change_comma_ including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot_comma_ and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man_comma_ those looooong winters!
1,Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?
0,Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.
0,lol_comma_ right. You will have great fun!
0,The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.
0,I agree!  Things look really good going forward.
0,Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.
0,I hope so as well_comma_ especially for my kids sake!
1,My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems_comma_ and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.
1,Im sorry to hear that _comma_ i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control
1,I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention_comma_ but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.
0,She really does need an intervention _comma_ and family and friends would help greatly _comma_ i hope she can get her life back together 
0,It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!
0,Oh my god_comma_ that's excellent! Congrats!
0,Oh_comma_ that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day_comma_ Halloween_comma_ visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.
1,Oh_comma_ lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?
0,The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful_comma_ in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!
0,Oh cool_comma_ yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?
1,The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!
1,I know how you feel! What did you watch?
1,I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.
1,It is a pretty good horror.
0,My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.
0,That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money
0,She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!
0,Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!
0,My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!
0,Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?
0,They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.
0,Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? 
0,I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!
0,That is excellent_comma_ what did you major in?
0,I majored in environmental engineering!
0,Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?
1,I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.
1,Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?
1,I plan on coming clean at some point_comma_ but I'm not sure how to break the news.
1,Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?
0,I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.
0,When is the last time you seen them?
0,I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.
0,That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!
0,I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.
1,Do you still talk with any of your older friends?
1,Yes_comma_ I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.
1,Do you have little time from working or other things?
1,I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!
1,Yikes what was it about?
1,A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.
1,creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?
0,I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary
0,That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.
1,Yes_comma_ it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.
0,Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.
1,I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.
1,at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.
1,Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much
1,i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling
0,I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.
0,I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.
1,We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.
1,He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!
1,Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!
1,Dang_comma_ that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?
1,Yeah_comma_ hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.
1,Ah_comma_ gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!
0,Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions
1,I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!
0,No_comma_ I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance
0,Well_comma_ if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)
1,I was recently working on a project where unfortunately_comma_ my teammate really didn't pull their weight.
1,That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.
1,Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time_comma_ you don't want to complain about it_comma_ because it makes *you* look bad!
1,There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)
1,I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.
1,I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?
1,I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.
1,That sucks_comma_ I hope you get it figured out!
1,Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash_comma_ water_comma_ important documents_comma_ a change of clothing.
0,wow_comma_ it must have been quite an experience
1,It was enough to wake me_comma_ but not the cat_comma_ lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!
0,My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe
0,Thank you_comma_ I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise_comma_ right! At least now I won't die of thirst.
0,I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times
0,Awesome. What breed did you own?
1,A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse 
0,I love paints_comma_ and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.
0,Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work. 
1,The other day I had a flat_comma_ but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.
0,10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. 
1,I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.
0,Practice makes perfect_comma_ or makes you fast in your case.
0,One time_comma_ my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous_comma_ naturally.
0,I would be too! Did you to it?
1,Yeah_comma_ I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.
0,So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? 
1,My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!
0,You must be so proud!
1,I am_comma_ but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here_comma_ bored stupid! I know_comma_ I'm being selfish.
0,I don't think you're being selfish_comma_ you're doing your best!
0,I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.
0,I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state_comma_ but should be interesting!
1,What state are you going to move to?
1,Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage_comma_ to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam_comma_ Zurich_comma_ and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state_comma_ it feels foreign somehow!
0,Oh that is nice_comma_ will you be going skiing?
0,I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate 
0,Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?
0,No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy. 
0,I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..
0,My traveling is more like a sleep / trance_comma_ or hypnosis 
1,Once_comma_ I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.
1,It must have being terrifying!
1,Yes_comma_ I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.
1,Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.
1,I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.
1,That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
1,Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.
1,I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
1,I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.
1,oh_comma_ that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?
0,Honestly_comma_ I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.
0,Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.
0,I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer_comma_ despite being busy with other customers_comma_ took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful_comma_ kind man!
0,That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?
0,Not at all. They were super nice_comma_ and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.
0,Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?
0,Sure! There's plenty of room_comma_ lol. Just be sure you like hot_comma_ steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!
0,I am in Central FL... so uhh.
0,I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well_comma_ this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me_comma_ that's for sure.
1,I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.
1,Ouch_comma_ I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.
1,Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck
1,Hmm_comma_ wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!
1,Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!
1,So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.
1,Luckily_comma_ they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.
1,But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
0,I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days_comma_ when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.
1,Ah_comma_ I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads_comma_ thinking the way we are now ;-))
1,Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha
0,As long as you keep your playful spirit_comma_ you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness_comma_ but I can see it in you!
0,I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.
0,It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?
0,I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.
0,That sounds like a lot of fun_comma_ it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring_comma_ so I'm happy you have that job!
1,I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed_comma_ frankly.
1,What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?
1,I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time_comma_ but I sure am wondering about my friendship!
1,Silver linings do happen_comma_ maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.
1,Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate_comma_ which is not something I'd expect of him.
1,Maybe not a true friend after all.
1,Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while_comma_ that's for sure!
0,I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.
1,I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
1,She won $5_comma_000 and never offered to share. 
1,That's a lot of money_comma_ to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off_comma_ or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
0,I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.
0,Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
1,I wouldn't say naturally smart_comma_ it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.
0,Well done! You should be proud.
1,I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.
1,If I'm understanding you correctly_comma_ they're going to clean it up_comma_ right?
1,Clean up_comma_ stabilize from future collapses_comma_ demolish vacant houses open closed roads_comma_ and so on
0,Wow_comma_ that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?
1,I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am_comma_ I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly_comma_ out of the darkness_comma_ appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!
1,What did they or the person do to you?
1,Well_comma_ I'm in a wheelchair_comma_ so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them_comma_ trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.
1,Broom would be a good choice_comma_ hit them in the crotch_comma_ that will stop them.
1,"Well_comma_ that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!"
0,My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.
0,That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?
0,Actually_comma_ I did! I moved across the world to Doha_comma_ Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me_comma_ it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?
0,No_comma_ I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However_comma_ I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.
1,I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.
1,Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?
1,There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also_comma_ technical difficulties.
1,I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
1,Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!
1,Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.
1,Exactly_comma_ I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving_comma_ which makes things even less safe 
1,Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!
0,I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.
0,That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!
0,I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?
0,Yes_comma_ I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!
1,I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.
1,There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?
1,Fortunately_comma_ it didn't_comma_ but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!
1,Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
1,I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.
1,I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad_comma_ especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.
1,Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness_comma_ imo.
1,I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.
1,It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace_comma_ but I guess not.
1,My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt_comma_ left home early_comma_ and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.
0,That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?
0,I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.
0,Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!
0,I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!
0,Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?
0,I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides_comma_ roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?
0,Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!
1,I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.
0,Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.
1,That may take awhile_comma_ but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.
0,Exactly_comma_ it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.
0,We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.
0,That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?
0,Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa_comma_ but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.
0,Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!
1,I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.
1,that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.
1,That's horrible_comma_ but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained_comma_ but she clearly had not!
1,oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.
1,I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.
0,What types of tv shows do you like to watch?
1,Everything really_comma_ I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.
1,Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?
0,Nah_comma_ I don't get to to bad.
0,I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!
0,Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.
0,I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa? 
0,Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.
1,Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.
1,Yea_comma_ I agree. Or they just really don't care.
1,This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.
0,I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.
0,Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?
0,Well_comma_ right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems
0,Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.
1,I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house
0,That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.
1,It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.
1,Yes_comma_ get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?
0,Yes_comma_ insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.
0,I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.
0,Wow_comma_ you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.
0,Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.
0,Well_comma_ I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!
0,I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.
0,That sounds like fun_comma_ do you have a big family?
1,No_comma_ I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family_comma_ you know?
1,Yes I understand_comma_ I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.
0,I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.
0,Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?
0,She is very young_comma_ and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.
0,thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer
0,You know you could still do it. I know you can.
0,yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
0,My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.
0,Aw_comma_ that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?
0,He lives about a couple hours away_comma_ but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!
0,That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed
1,You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well_comma_ that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.
1,Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that_comma_ lol.
0,It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though_comma_ and thanks for the advice.
0,Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!
1,I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.
1,Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.
1,Yes_comma_ it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.
1,You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.
1,Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.
0,Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well_comma_ and I love going to see it.
0,That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?
0,It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages_comma_ to jewelry and lots of other things.
0,I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?
0,I have another job so I can't do too much_comma_ but I love going in to see her. 
0,I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!
1,I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!
0,Wow_comma_ I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.
0,It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!
0,I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad_comma_ and I'm glad that you adapted well.
0,Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!
0,I think I might. It sound exciting_comma_ and I thank you for the encouragement.
0,I recently got very sick_comma_ and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.
0,That's unfortunate_comma_ but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.
0, Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.
0,I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.
1,I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior_comma_ simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.
1,I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? 
1,We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!
1,Yes_comma_ I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!
1,Me too! <fist bump> ;-)
1,So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.
0,Wow_comma_ that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?
0,He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here_comma_ and he's only ever had one friend over.
1,Ah_comma_ maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. 
1,I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.
1,It should be harder to get a license than it is.
1,I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?
1,It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.
1,You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.
1,Oh my gosh_comma_ I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? 
1,She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.
1,They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.
1,I will_comma_ and thank you so much for the encouragement.
1,I've been passively job hunting for a few months now_comma_ looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.
0,Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.
1,Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too. 
0,Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter_comma_ and don't ever give up!!
0,One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.
0,That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?
0,She told me she wants to become a dentist_comma_ but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year. 
0,As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!
1,June and July are very busy_comma_ June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.
1,it has been really busy even for me at work _comma_ i feel your pain
1,So much for relaxing during the summer?
1,I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol
1,Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.
1,Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. 
1,It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.
1,I think I would pass out from fear lol.
1,You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.
1,I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.
0,I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food
0,That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?
0,I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all
0,That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.
1,I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.
0,I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.
0,oh man that sounds like serious stuff _comma_and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great
0,When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.
1,That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?
0,I was and she was had a full recovery. 
0,That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.
1,Me neither_comma_ my mom means so much to me. 
0,Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.
0,Do you get to see your mom often?
1,Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.
0,I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!
0,Those cars are pretty slick_comma_ what color was it?
0,It was blue with white racing stripes. 
0,Wow_comma_ one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that_comma_ that's awesome
0,Same here_comma_ they are pretty expensive. 
1,My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.
1,UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.
1,This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.
1,I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.
0,My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.
0,That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?
0,She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert. 
0,Yummy_comma_ You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!
0,Thank you! What is your favorite meal?
1,Me too_comma_ do you have a favorite flavor?
1,My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.
1,when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies _comma_ for some reason the sad movies made me cry_comma_ but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new
1,I know_comma_ it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together. 
1,it happens to the best of us_comma_ and i totally understand where your coming from _comma_ spend some time with your friends or loved ones 
0,My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry. 
0,What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.
0,He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.
0,That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts 
0,I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility. 
0,Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.
0,Thank you_comma_ I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.
0,What is your work area?
0,I work in the military 
0,My daughter can say so many new words_comma_ love to see her thrive!
0,That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha_comma_ that's a tongue twister.
0,Yes_comma_ thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?
0,I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?
1,I've got all of my bags packed_comma_ passport ready_comma_ and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.
0,I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited_comma_ I've never been.
0,Oh wow_comma_ I hope you have fun
0,So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.
0,Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?
0,Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.
0,I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?
0,I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had_comma_ haha.
0,Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.
0,So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!
0,Very nice_comma_ wind in your hair_comma_ exercise_comma_ and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?
0,It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?
0,I am actually home bound_comma_ but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!
1,It's so quiet in my house_comma_ just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.
0,I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.
1,That is a great attitude to have_comma_ my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2_comma_000 miles away in Alaska!
0,You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support_comma_ no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!
0,Whenever we moved abroad_comma_ I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.
0,You sound like you're embracing life!
0,Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time_comma_ so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.
0,Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.
0,Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam_comma_ Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome_comma_ by the way!)
0,It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.
0,Oh wow_comma_ I'd be really jealous of him.
1,I certainly am! Of course_comma_ I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.
1,Well_comma_ hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.
0,So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!
0,Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?
0,I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own_comma_
0,I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.
0,Its always nice to catch up
0,Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.
0,I hope you keep doing thaty
0,I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!
1,Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA_comma_ and I do miss my home
0,Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same_comma_ you know?
1,Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!
1,I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman. 
1,Were you happy about that_comma_ or creeped out?
0,I respectfully told her I was not interested_comma_ I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.
0,You're a good guy. Did she take it well?
0,I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!

0,My wife had a similar experience_comma_ she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.
1,I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience_comma_ and not altogether pleasant.
1,That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?
1,Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard_comma_ but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.
1,At least you saved money doing it yourself!
1,In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.
1,Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry
1,It's ok.  I'm basically over it now_comma_ but it was really angering then.

0,I was grateful when I married my wife

0,I've had pets to do that too.
1,It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!
0,Well_comma_ I guess it really loves you.
0,I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect_comma_ but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!
1,I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.
1,Yeah_comma_ we would take a bottle of wine with us_comma_ watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.
0,Times like that would be so awesome! I hope they come back for you
0,Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet_comma_ imho!
0,I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow
0,A spelling bee - what fun! I'm sure you will win - I bet you've worked hard toward your goal.

0,It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.
0,"Thats one way to get them. being a ""big girl"" is such an accomplishment"
1,My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.
1,Do you guys get to talk a lot?
1,Yeah_comma_ we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though_comma_ we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.
1,Getting through it can only make your relationshipi stronger though
1,I was sad when my dog died

1,it wasn't that scary to me
0,I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.
0,Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.
1,No one writes letters anymore... its kind of sad
1,I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.
1,That would definitely creep me out.
1,Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.
1,I have done that before lol
0,I'm so proud of my wife
0,i bet she's a wonderful woman
1,I was angry when my son destroyed my car

0,Congratulations!  Don't be too nervous!  You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
1,That's true_comma_ but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.
0,That is natural.  I'm sure you will do great!
1,I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend_comma_ I was worried about them.
0,Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some_comma_ but overall it was fine.
1,My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.
1,Wow_comma_ i bet you miss her so much. My wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for 1 month! I know i will be miserable without them
0,It sucks_comma_ but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P
1,I will play PubG after work to keep me busy lol
1,My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon_comma_ but it's been tough without her.
0,Well it will be over soon
0,I'm looking forward to it :)
1,I bet you are. I definitely woudl be
1,I'm planning on moving to a new city_comma_ but I'm starting to get cold feet.
1,What has you so nervous?
1,I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?
0,Have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
1,One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it_comma_ one of my coworkers bailed on me.
1,Did it leave you to do it alone_comma_ or were there others ?
1,There were others_comma_ but we needed all the help we could get.
1,I see how that would be frustrating.
0,Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing_comma_ I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time
0,I've heard about this movie but i've never had a chance to watch it
0,omg_comma_ you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it_comma_ it's about aliens
0,Aliens? I didn't think it was about aliens_comma_ i thought it's about ghosts and stuff
0,it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff_comma_ and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.
1,Well I wouldn't know lol
0,Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.

1,I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table
1,It was brussel sprouts and Liver

0,Oh thats good for your friend_comma_ but it sounds like you really would like to live there! I can imagine feeling jealous
0,Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!
0,You will get there! I would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!
1,When I was planning my wedding_comma_ the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.
1,Oh no_comma_ did you find a backup caterer
1,Yeah_comma_ we dropped them with enough time to find someone else_comma_ but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.
1,Of course_comma_ the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
1,It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/
1,i like to call them deadbeats
1,Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.
1,what do you collect for ? credit cards or utilities ?
1,We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.
0,I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@
0,Oh I just did that recently. I just got back from 2 months. It will be a fantastic time.
0,I went to Thailand and Vietnam. Dont worry about anything. Traveling was so easy and people are nice everywhere.
1,I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.
1,I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.
1,Oh wow_comma_ I would of been terrified!
1,I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back
1,Was it a large amount?
1,Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back
1,That's rough. I'm sorry that must put you in a real bind.
1,I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.
1,Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.
0,It reallyi s the best way to do things. That way even if you forget something you've got time to remember and remedy the situation
0,Fortunately_comma_ my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.
0,Haha_comma_ sometimes wifes are nice to have around.
1,My wife was working yesterday_comma_ but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.
0,That sounds lovely. Did yall make it a special day to remember?
0,We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.
0,That sounds fantastic. Im sure you guys will remember that day for a while. What a nice surprise.
1,I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing_comma_ but I felt a little bad about it :P
1,why you should feel bad.. i am not getting you my friend
1,Not like really bad_comma_ just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal_comma_ but I feel bad when I do things like that.
1,oh.. you must be sweet then.. your wife is lucky
1,That horror movie made me terrified
1,What movie was it ?
1,The worst a movie has gotten me was Event Horizon.
1,I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it_comma_ don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap
0,wow lol I didn't know you can track ovulation. Good luck with getting pregannt
1,thank you :) oh yeah_comma_ you can track ovulation_comma_ measure basal body temperature_comma_ etc. I'm not gonna go into details
0,please don't lol i'm a man_comma_ I appreciate what you women go through when you're pregnant or on your period but i'm okay with not knowing details
0,My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.
0,Its the worse having to wait for something you really want. 
0,Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.
0,Oh nice. Make a nice lunch to keep yourself busy. The delivery will be there in no time if you keep yourself busy.
0,It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.
0,Yes I agree. I did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed.
0,Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.
0,Mine has been around 7 years and it's been a little rocky.
1,I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.
1,Oh no. Is he responsible with school or a job?
1,He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.
1,I understand_comma_ he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!
0,My wife usually sniffs out anything going on_comma_ but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.
0,Did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?
0,Yes. Friends_comma_ family_comma_ cake_comma_ all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.
0,That's a great job! Well done!
0,Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again_comma_ but happy it worked this time.
0,I am so grateful for my wife
0,Yeah_comma_ she seems like a great woman_comma_ you're lucky to have her.
0,She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her
0,You should take her on a vacation_comma_ or something. She deserves it.
1,I can handle_comma_ bees_comma_ scorpions_comma_ wasps_comma_ crickets_comma_ and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.
1,At least you can handle those. I can't do any of those
1,I take some conselation in that_comma_ however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.
1,Well_comma_ they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes
1,I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party
1,Understandable.  What was the reason?
1,I was working and I couldn't leave early
1,Did you explain it to them.  That's a pretty good reason to miss it.
1,As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.
1,Fortunately_comma_ she rarely was gone for long periods of time_comma_ but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.
1,How's your relationship now ?
0,I am so excited about going to the movies
0,Oh cool! What movie are you going to see?
0,I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while
0,Oh awesome! It's a new one?
1,I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks
0,that's extremely sweet of you! you're a nice person. my wife and i made some blessing bags and we give them everytime we see homeless people
1,blessing bags?? what are those?
1,basically it's a bag with necessities. we put some water_comma_ some non perishable foods_comma_ snacks_comma_ some wipes and a little bit of money
0,wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing
1,The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.
1,What a great idea_comma_ where did that come from?
1,Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it_comma_ so I don't really know which one_comma_ but you can find a bunch on there.
1,Well I need to keep that in mind_comma_ great suggestion 
0,Well_comma_ what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems_comma_ and I was right.
0,Oh wow_comma_ what a long trip. How long did it take?
0,Six days in all_comma_ but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.
0,That is a long time to be in the car for sure.
0,It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas_comma_ some with free coffee!
0,Oh well that's a plu!
0,Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!
0,So where did you stop along the way?
0,I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.
0,Well at least you have a plan. Are you planning to start the renovation soon?
0,Yes_comma_ hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.
0,Awesome. I'm sure it's going to turn out great.
1,I was so anxious for my kid to graduate
0,I can understand that. Did it end up going ok?
0,It did. I'm very proud of him
0,That's good. I'm glad everything worked out.
0,I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs
0,that's good to hear! Good for you! Maybe i should go to the pool too lol 
0,it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing
0,true! Do you just swim or you do some water aerobics?
0,I hope when I get older_comma_ Im not lonely as I am now
1,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been married?
1,I was engaged but my woman left me
1,I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to be.
0,I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.
0,That's such a good tune.
1,Yeah_comma_ for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.
0,Yeah_comma_ it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.
1,I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.
1,Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated_comma_ without showing anger.
1,True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.
1,Yeah_comma_ just stay positive about it_comma_ I'm sure you'll figure something out.
1,K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there_comma_ but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.
1,Was it just a bad feeling you had?
1,It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.
1,Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified_comma_ but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.
1,I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.
1,Oh yeah_comma_ the buffering?  Very annoying.
1,Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie_comma_ and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.
1,I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.
0,My eldest niece_comma_ who helps take care of her younger disabled sister_comma_ graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.
0,Did you get her something special?
0,Yes_comma_ I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland_comma_ so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.
0,Oh awesome_comma_ That is great!
0,I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.
1,I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.
1,You wont know an answer if you dont ask
1,Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.
1,I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it_comma_ what a waste of time
1,That sucks_comma_ after going all that way too and you didn't even get to try it. I'm sorry.
1,thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good
1,I hope you do get to try it soon. Be sure to let me know how it is!
1,My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.
1,Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.
1,Wonder if it has to do with his diet?
1,It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.
1,Will he be back soon?
1,I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(
1,Okay_comma_ I see. That must be hard.
1,I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.
1,I think we've all done a version of that.
1,I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.
1,It's been a hard day today_comma_ its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.
1,That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?
1,In a few months_comma_ he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!
0,You must be so proud of him!
1,My young niece_comma_ who is disabled_comma_ was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.
1,What was going on with her?
1,Chest infection which_comma_ for her_comma_ can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.
0,That sounds pretty serious_comma_ glad she is okay now!
0,It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too_comma_ but they live in Scotland.
1,I have this cat that loves to cause issues 
1,Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table 
1,Cats are always getting into things and causing destruction.
1,I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.
1,Oh no_comma_ could you ask your supervisor for guidance?
1,Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.
1,Sounds like you have a good plan. I wish you the best
0,I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet
0,That was very sweet. What movie did you want to watch?
0,it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already
0,Oh ok! The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'
1,A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would. 
1,So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way
1,It was_comma_ but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker. 
1,Well_comma_ at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you
1,That is true_comma_ I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover. 
1,My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.
1,So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.
1,Yeah.  It could be worse_comma_ but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.
1,Yeah_comma_ I can imagine. At least it's only one week!
0,It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.
0,Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.
0,After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.
0,I am sure you will create a beautiful house.
1,Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.
1,Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had it since it was a kitten?
1,Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.
1,That is so sad. I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.
1,It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street
1,Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?
1,I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity
1,Well that's good of you.  Do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?
1,My husband shocked me the other day 
1,Why did he do that?
0,He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death! 
0,Oh my_comma_ did you have a good time?
1,I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.
1,I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?
1,No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?
0,No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.
1,I was planning to view the stars last night_comma_ but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.
1,It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?
1,It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.
1,I may have to check that out as well.
0,A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.
0,Yes_comma_ but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.
1,Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.
1,Yes_comma_ the first years of a baby's life_comma_ the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.
0,My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!
0,That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times. We are workcamping in the mountains of NM and my Mom lives in TX.
0,I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.
0,We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol. Now that we are fulltime RVers_comma_ they dont follow. I miss that sometimes. I am glad you have your Mom close! Cherish those times!!
1,I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.

0,Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.
0,It really does_comma_ hope any you have works out!
1,i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it
1,Oh I know! I could kill people like that.
1,i know right_comma_ it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me
1,And they don't have a voice of their own.
0,the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day
0,Congratulations! What made it so great?
0,the fact that it took so much work and time
0,Ah_comma_ well you earned it!

0,yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment
0,wow then... do you have any special plans to celebrate ?
0,I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago. 
0,Thats very admirable of you.  How do you help her?
1,We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.
1,We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.
0,Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.
1,We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues_comma_ no matter your views.
1,I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.
1,Exactly_comma_ let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!
1,Everyone is always fighting over these things_comma_ it's a sad thing to see.
1,I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab_comma_ working by myself.
1,Yes_comma_ it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.
0,Hope you had good time after your work!
1,I miss my dog Kat
1, I am so sorry to hear that.
0,Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog
0,I hope you find a new puppy love soon.
1,Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.
0,It's great to see my husband doing so well.
0,I am glad to hear that!  What is happening with him?
0,He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.
0,That is awesome!  I hope he got a good raise
1,Hello_comma_ I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable
1,I can't imagine why people would do that. Animals are helpless.
1,I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit
1,You're very empathetic then! I hate seeing animals suffer as well.
1,it's something since I was born ... I'm like that
1,That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark. 
1,Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice_comma_ but I hear the people there aren't/
1,Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also. 
1,That's cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?
1,I really miss my puppy_comma_ we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.
0,Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? 
0,Yes_comma_ she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.
1,Im so sorry_comma_ pets are like children 
1,my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don
1,Teething is a hard period for babies and moms
1,it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good_comma_ doesn't want to eat. poor little boy
1,Poor baby. I remember my kids teething too. It was horrible
1,i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college
1,Ha ha_comma_ I'm sure he'll get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to.
1,I hope so_comma_ i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face
1,I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.
0,I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.
1,How does that make you feel ?
0,I wish I were with them.  I love Italy
0,I've never left the US. I've never been north of Kentucky.
1,Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.
0,I've spent my life turning my home into where I want to be_comma_ instead of where I want to leave.
0,That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures
0,My friend bought me lunch today
0,That was nice. What did you have?
0,I had a nice burger and fries
0,That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.
0,Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch
1,I hate when people pull in front of you_comma_ especially when it's clear behidn you.
1,It is very annoying! I hate it too
1,Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.
1,Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that
1,yes_comma_ sadly I easily can.
1,I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy
1,That;s ok_comma_ everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others.
1,That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on
1,Hey_comma_ I can't sleep without socks. It's no big deal.
0,I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.
0,That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it
0,They do. They get to smell the grass_comma_ they play they get their exercise_comma_ they get to have fun_comma_ they get to be a dog! 
0,They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! :)
1,Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street
1,Oh no_comma_ did you have candles and flashlights available?
1,We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power
1,Good thing_comma_ you have to be prepared for those situations
1,A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.
1,Oh I am so sorry. Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. 
1,I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it
1,Yea I feel you. At the end of the day you cant blame the cat. It didnt do this on purpose.
1,I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross! 
1,Man I'm sorry to hear that...I've wasted a good protein shake doing that once
1,don't you hate that? gosh_comma_ i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore
1,Oh well I was starving...I just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
0,I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows 
0,I use to live in an older house that had a tin roof_comma_ and I'd always love hearing the rain beat on it! Helped me sleep like a baby_comma_.
0,It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too! 
0,I wonder if that's a common thing? It's very relaxing.
1,i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere
1,I'm sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?
1,not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up 
0,I'm so sorry but you'll get there in time.
0,Though the odds are against you_comma_ I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.
0,I've never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?
0,Well_comma_ take this with a grain of salt_comma_ but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do_comma_ and on the first deal_comma_ I hit $1000. I went nuts_comma_ cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!
0,Wow_comma_ check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though.
0,I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.
0,Yes_comma_ it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras.
0,Mardi Gras is great_comma_ but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town_comma_ and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole_comma_ and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!
0,That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!
1,I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?
1,I'd say that'd be a real disappointment to say the least.
1,You can say that again. One time_comma_ I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.
1,I am not quite sure what you mean by that?
1,sorry that was sent by an mistake
1,That's OK_comma_ It happens to the best of us!
1,I don't think I am a judgmental person_comma_ but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day_comma_ and I can still smell it.
1,Trust me_comma_ this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off_comma_ they had running clean water_comma_ but no toilet indoors! 
0,I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.
0,Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?
0,I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.
0,It's good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!
0,I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at_comma_ the possibility looks good! 
1,Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?
1,I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.
1,That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!
1,Did you make the party anyway?
1,Not too long ago_comma_ my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it! 
0,Wow. That is a blessing
0,Yes_comma_ I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought_comma_ I am blessed.
0,I am going to always take care of my kids like that
0,I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible 
0,I hate doing dishes any way
0,I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me! 
0,So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!
0,Cool I just finished today
0,I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.
0,Yeah we had a hard time today lol
0,And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!  
0,I am going to do like you next year for sure!
0,I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!
1,I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong 
1,The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to
0,I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!
1,Was it like black friday? lol
1,YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was_comma_ usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no_comma_ not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!
1,Stick to your routine next time
1,I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year_comma_ I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  
0,I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online
1,Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!
0,plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals
1,The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider 
1,Ew_comma_ I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.
1,I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that! 
1,Oh no_comma_ throw it away!!!!
1,"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater_comma_ but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much."
1,How was it too much?
1,"Well_comma_ to their credit_comma_ they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK_comma_ but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!"
1,Around this time of the year_comma_ my husband usually always gets a large bonus_comma_ but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!
1,How big is the bonus usually?
0,It all depends_comma_ but always has been thousands. So_comma_ the waiting drives us nuts!
0,Wow_comma_ well I hope you guys get it this year then!
0,When my friend told me to give him my last $400_comma_ I thought he was crazy. But in the end_comma_ I am glad I did.
1,Why did you do that?
0,He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!
0,Wow_comma_ good for you guys!
1,Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.
1,I was about 16 at the time. The thing is_comma_ I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!
1,That is young_comma_ I wish someone had helped you!
0,I don't know how you are with Calc_comma_ but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.
0,Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.
0,Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!
0,That was very altruistic of her! 
1,My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night 
1,Why she is doing that?
1,She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! 
0,I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27_comma_ I would have thought you were crazy.
0,why did you go back?
0,I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer_comma_ but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra_comma_ and was accepted to a state university two years ago! 
0,good for you_comma_ best of luck!!
1,i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college
1,Oh no. Did you have a good backup plan ?
1,yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha
1,Maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
1,My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...
1,How did that make you feel?
1,Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her. 
0,I understand! I would feel the same way.
0,i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years
0,What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really
0,gaming has blown up this past couple of years 
0,Oh you're right_comma_ it has. I hear about it more and more
1,I love roller coasters_comma_ but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter. 
1,I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?
1,Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around_comma_ all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.
0,I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!
0,I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.
0,Ooh_comma_ congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?
1,I'm an Engineering major_comma_ electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?
0,That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer_comma_ actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself.
0,i really am thankful for everything that i have and had
0,What is your most prized posession?
0,it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little
0,he gave it to me beafore he went to the army_comma_ and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional
0,My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!
0,Oh wow_comma_ maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.
0,Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?
0,You must be very proud of him! Yes_comma_ I love to bowl with my family but I'm not very good at it!
1,I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.
1,That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?\
1,No I don't_comma_ I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!
1,Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!
1,So I suck hard at bowling_comma_ but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.
1,Ha ha! I have done that_comma_ too. So embarrassing.
1,Yeah_comma_ my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.
1,Phew_comma_ so they got most of the attention.
1,I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend_comma_ for various reasons_comma_ but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!
1,It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.
1,Yes_comma_ and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus_comma_ I really hated to hurt her_comma_ but I guess I should have told her.
1,Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.
1,I still live and work in the place where I grew up_comma_ but all of my friends have moved away.
1,Aw_comma_ that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?
1,No_comma_ everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night_comma_ so I keep to myself at home_comma_ alone.
1,How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!
1,So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.
1,School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?
1,I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.
1,Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this_comma_ I'd say you'll be very successful in life.
0,So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!
0,oh you're gonna be awesome i bet!
0,Thanks_comma_ I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.
0,yeah that always happens_comma_ don't be hard on yourself as long you do great
0,So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.
0,Surprisingly enough_comma_ a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!
0,I haven't met a pizza I didn't like yet.
1,my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru
1,I remember my kids going through that. Do you have teething rings for him?
1,I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad
1,Poor boy. I hope he gets through it soon.
1,I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.
0,What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.
0,World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.
0,Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did ya'll play online together a lot?
1,I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.
1,Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?
1,Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.
1,Yikes_comma_ that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.
1,I think storms are wonderful_comma_ except when the power goes out.
1,I love storms too but yeah_comma_ that's a nuisance.
1,It was extra loud and my husband was at work_comma_ bit scary.
1,Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by_comma_ did it?
1,O it sure seemed like it did_comma_ dogs were scared too.
0,College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!
0,That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?
0,It probably will be_comma_ as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!
0,That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.
0,I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.
0,Awww_comma_ what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.
0,It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories_comma_ things were often simpler and more carefree back then.
0,I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow_comma_ it was so neat to see!
1,So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere_comma_ he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.
1,For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!
1,How long has he been bowling?
1,I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.
0,I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?
0,it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.
1,Well_comma_ it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you.
1,So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.
1,That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?
1,For sure_comma_ that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose_comma_ can't expect to be perfect!
1,Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that_comma_ we'd all be out of jobs.
1,So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.
0,That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?
1,No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself_comma_ would do again!
0,Man_comma_ I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.
0,So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!
0,Oh my god_comma_ Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?
1,I don't think so actually_comma_ I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!
0,That is hilarious_comma_ In a cruel kind of way.
1,So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.
0,Ohh_comma_ I feel you. I felt the same way_comma_ when I was planning to buy a new car.
1,Yep. Like_comma_ my current car is dying_comma_ but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.
0,Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!
1,PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!
1,Wow why would they even do that?
1,It was during a power outage during a hurricane_comma_  still made me mad.
1,Sheesh_comma_ people will take anything that's not nailed down these days.
1,So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!
1,That's terrible to hear. Is it old?
1,Oh yes_comma_ very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now_comma_ I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.
1,Are you thinking of getting a new car?
1,I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.
1,Me too. Its nerve wrecking
0,I know! Like_comma_ mentally_comma_ I don't care_comma_ but my body just responds by making my legs shake_comma_ my heart pound_comma_ and speaking too quickly.
1,Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
1,I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times_comma_ it was awful.
1,Ohh_comma_ cleaning dog poop is always been annoying_comma_ yet petting the dog is always amusing.
1,Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them_comma_ but I would be lying.
1,Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!
1,So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.
1,That has happened to me several times
1,Yeah_comma_ not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.
1,Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner
0,I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester. 
0,Were you able to get them?
0,Yes_comma_ everything's taken care of_comma_ thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!
0,That was so sweet of him! You're lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend
0,i was really glad i finished my service for the military
0,Thanks you for your service
0,it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country
1,i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid
0,I have never had that feeling.
0,yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well
0,Well thats good. Probaby saved a bunch of coins
1,i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad
1,I would also cry with you!
1,yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now
1,I cry at least a day!
1,i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants
1,oof that sucks really bad
1,yeah_comma_ i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off_comma_ it is really embarrasing
1,yea i can imagine it is

0,We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know_comma_ they were ahead four runs.
0,Whoa that is always exciting. Baseball can be boring at times.
0,Yes_comma_ usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.
0,I love sports. I am glad you got to experience that.
0,My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!
0,Woot! That's great! Which brand are you thinking?
0,I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.
0,Toyota is a great choice
1,Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!! 
1,EW OMG Did you kill it?
1,heck no_comma_ i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door
0,Well_comma_ don't you know_comma_ one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!
0,That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?
0,This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.
0,Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.
1,Ooh_comma_ I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?
0,It's located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
0,I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC_comma_ where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!
1,You should definitely check to see_comma_ or stop by Cabot if you ever visit Vermont.
1,my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much
1,I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ that's very sad. Were you two close?
1,yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often
1,That's a bummer_comma_ I'm sure he is looking out for you up above!
1,I had planned to go to the beach with friends_comma_ but it looks like it's going to rain.
1,Ah man_comma_ that's a buzz kill_comma_ are you still going to rough it out in the rain?
1,Nah_comma_ it said there's be thunder and lightning_comma_ so looks like we're stuck inside :(
1,Ah dang_comma_ well there's always next weekend!
1,I spent last weekend with most of my family_comma_ they live out of state and i don't see them often.
0,Did you have a good time visiting with them?
0,I did_comma_ Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them. 
1,What did you guys do?
0,We ate good food_comma_ drank wine and went swimming. 
0,That sounds fun.  Was the weather nice?
0,It was_comma_ kind of hot but not enough to complain about. 
1,What sort of food did you eat?
1,I hate how our country is so divided right now
1,It is_comma_ but I think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now.
1,True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things
1,Maybe_comma_ but I think the best we can hope for is tolerance.
1,My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.
1,I'm very sorry to hear that.  Losing anyone close to you_comma_ especially a parent would be very hard.  Are you close to other members of your family and were you able to help each other through it?
1,Yes_comma_ my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But_comma_ my sister had passed away around 6 years before_comma_ by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.
1,I bet it has.  Keep sticking by with your family.  I'm sure you are all there for each other more than you know.
1,I feel like a terrible sibling right now. 
1,What did you do to feel that way?
1,My sister_comma_ who lives out of state and i don't see often_comma_ was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.
1,I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ you could make it up to them by going to visit?
0,I am going to a concert very soon.
0,Cool! Who are you going to see?
0,Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall_comma_ do you know them?
0,Of course! Grace is so talented! She was on America's Got Talent_comma_ right? I get all those reality talent shows confused.
0,Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!
0,It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.
0,Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!
1,School for my kids started again this past Thursday.
1,How was that? Were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? Or are you sad that it shows that they're getting older?
0,It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies_comma_ clothes_comma_ shoes_comma_ and other odds and ends in time.
0,"Ah_comma_ that's interesting you say that. I thought you'd just be like everyone else_comma_ who say_comma_ ""Happy to nudge them out the door!"" You sound like a good parent"
1,I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.
1,What beach were you heading too?
0,We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.
0,Who all went with you? That sound so fun.
0,My husband_comma_ 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.
0,That's awesome_comma_ have you ever tried surfing?
1,I bought a ticket last week for the lottery_comma_ when it was over 100 million dollars.
0,I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn_comma_ but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.
1,Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win :)
0,True_comma_ but it would be fun spending that money.
0,My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news
0,That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.
0,It sure does. It came as a shock_comma_ but a pleasant one. 
1,Yes_comma_ that would be a great surprise. It can also take a lot of stress off of you.
0,I just went today to visit my son in his new house.
0,It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it. 
1,So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!
1,You should make a wheel you can spin to decide.  I did that once.
1,That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.
1,Yes you put all the places on it and spin..
1,Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.
1,Put that on there too!
1,I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol
0,I'm so happy that it is Friday!
0,Oh me too! Do you have a monday to Friday type job?
0,Somewhat_comma_ I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?
0,Oh that is a pretty good schedule. I am a teacher so I'm off right now. It's wonderful. 
1,feels disappointed because my friend fights with me
1,Maybe its time for a new friend.
0,no i can't because i love him a lot
1,ask him to stop being a jerk?
1,I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.
1,Oh dear_comma_ that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?
1,yes_comma_ but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun
1,Oh_comma_ I'm really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. 
1,Some time ago_comma_ there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes_comma_ a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it_comma_ or harm my familY!
1,I'm glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.
1,No_comma_ they are so awful! They can destroy so much.
1,Have you only had to deal with one?
0,My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently
0,Well_comma_ that's very nice. I'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.
0,I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.
0,That's was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!
0,I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.
0,That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?
1,Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.
0,Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.
0,I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her
0,That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.
0,I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.
0,Don't ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!
1,A few weeks ago_comma_ we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But_comma_ it rained several days_comma_ so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted_comma_ which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.
1,Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?
1,Oh_comma_ no_comma_ it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So_comma_ a long time since we first went.
1,That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.
0,My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting
0,Hah_comma_ seems we both had some luck. Good for him!
0,I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.
0,You guys should go out and celebrate! 
0,We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man_comma_ so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.
1,Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!
1,We didn't have much choice_comma_ as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat_comma_ so if we didn't_comma_ we'd come back to not having pets. But_comma_ I wouldn't just let anybody_comma_ that's for sure!
0,I am happy for you! 
1,My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell
1,Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets
1,I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things
1,Aw_comma_ perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us
1,One night when my children and I came home_comma_ I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!
1,Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!
1,It was so scary! Luckily_comma_ it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up_comma_ but it first appeared to be an intruder!
1,Well I'm glad you were ok! Sometimes it's not just a shadow
0,Last weekend_comma_ my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together_comma_ and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home_comma_ just enjoying each other's company.
0,That's the best kind of day.
0,Yes_comma_ it was drama free and a relaxing time.
0,Must have been so nice_comma_ what movie did you watch?
1,My dog_comma_ riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
1,I am so sorry to hear about Riley_comma_ I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?
1,It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps
1,Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.
1,I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support_comma_ and that's why I didn't tell her. But_comma_ I still felt so bad about it.
1,I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? 
1,Well_comma_ she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job_comma_ plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.
1,Well money is not everything_comma_ one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse.
1,I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.  
1,Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?
1,I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take
1,It's OK to be nervous_comma_ but don't let it stop you!  No risk_comma_ no reward!
1,There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments_comma_ so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating_comma_ since it causes others more work.
1,That sucks_comma_ I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people
1,Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over_comma_ but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!
1,That's horrible_comma_ you should tell the boss and get her fired
1,My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning_comma_ and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.
1,I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with_comma_ especially for a child.
1,Yes_comma_ she was only about 9_comma_ and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!
1,I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! 
0,I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.
0,Not normally_comma_ so I was quite surprised. 
0,how much did you win?
0,$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.
0,I have never won that much. Congratulations
1,Thank you_comma_ that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out. 
1,I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day. 
1,Someone backed into my new car.
1,Oh geez_comma_ thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.
1,Yes_comma_ they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it. 
1,Many years ago_comma_ we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her_comma_ but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!
1,Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?
1,Well_comma_ she was attractive and at the time_comma_ I thought he was thinking that too. But_comma_ I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place_comma_ since she was falling down. But_comma_ it was hard to see it at that time lol
1,I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.
1,Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy
1,Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night. 
1,Oh god- Do you live in the country?
1,Not really. I live in town_comma_ but it's a small town.
1,Then the person might be caught_comma_ do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this
1,That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.
1,It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders_comma_ robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety 
1,My aunt came to visit today_comma_ we went out for mexican food!
1,That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?
1,Yes_comma_ kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours_comma_ she is on a road trip!
1,That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!
1,I have a big exam for college coming up_comma_ I have been studying day and night.
0,It is for my molecular biology class_comma_ I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it. 
0,I wish you good luck!
0,I went and saw a hockey game today_comma_ It was really exciting.
0,That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?
1,No_comma_ I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool. 
0,Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!
1,I was on a run today_comma_ and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!
0,That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.
1,Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!
0,Ha ha_comma_ guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it.
1,I got some bad news today_comma_ my dad passed away.
1,oh my goodness thats terrible_comma_ i am so sorry!
1,Thank you_comma_ I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.
1,i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted
1,Its so quiet in my house_comma_ my husband is out of town for work.
0,Hey I like alone time!  Just gotta find some cool stuff to do!
1,True_comma_ I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha
0,oh no!!  The ghosts are coming!! Yeah turn the TV up LOUD :D
0,I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!
0,Holy cow that's awesome!!!  What are you going to do with all that extra moneys??
0,Not sure yet_comma_ but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!
0,My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!
0,I am so amazed by her! 
0,That is very good. You should be proud of her.
1,I ate way too many sweets today! 
1,Thanks! Being on a diet is hard_comma_ espically with family in town!
1,I was running today and felt like this car was following me..
1,Yes it was_comma_ I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something
1,Also some kind of sound alert. You think you could scream for help during those times_comma_ but a lot of people actually don't.
1,Im watching the show The Bold Type_comma_ my favourtie characters dad died :(
0,is that a good show? i have never heard of it
0,Yes_comma_ it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.
0,It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!
0,That does sound like a great night! I think I'm overdue for one of those myself!
0,Yes defenitly_comma_ It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.
0,That's great. It's nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves.
1,My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months_comma_ Im worried for the change.
0,That is a big change!  Are you moving due to a job or something like that?
0,My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..
0,Yes_comma_ that is definitely a big change.  I hope you settle in quickly though - change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval_comma_ but it could also be the best thing ever!
0,I recently moved into a new home. 
0,Nice. Do you like your new neighborhood?
0,Yes_comma_ there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with. 
0,That is great. Why did you move?
0,We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home. 
1,I had a doctors appointment today.
1,I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?
1,I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back. 
1,I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.
1,I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever. 
1,I had just moved in to my new apartment_comma_ and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.
1,Aww - did you feed the cat?
0,At first I tried to resist_comma_ but I ended up adopting him!
1,That's how we have our cat also - how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point aren't they?
1,I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning. 
1,Ugh!  I'm assuming that it woke you up?
1,Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number. 
1,Oh my goodness!!  How irritating!  I hope they didn't call back?
1,She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there. 
0,I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.
0,No way! Congrats! I'm having twins sometime this coming week
0,Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us. 
0,That's nice! Kids are great
0,Yes they are. They make life worth living. 
0,Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!
0,I've always loved Halloween! Some people get crazy creative!
0,It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor_comma_ and everyone agreed it was terrifying!
0,That's awesome! Now that I have kids_comma_ I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year.
1,Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire. 
1,Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?
1,Yes_comma_ thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened. 
1,I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?
1,No_comma_ we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had. 
0,When me and my friend got lost in the desert_comma_ I thought we were done for.
0,scary! how long were you lost for?
0,Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.
0,oh good... I was imagining days
0,I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher. 
0,Do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?
0,Yes_comma_ I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great. 
0,A good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have - I hope your daughter has a great year.
0,Thanks so much. I completely agree. 
1,I just finished watching the Saw movie. 
1,I just cannot watch horror movies!!  Did you like it?
1,I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much! 
1,Oh I am right there with you!  The last scary movie I watched made it where I couldn't sleep that night.
1,Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it. 
1,I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks. 
0,Oh yeah?  Do you still look awesome like you did back then?
0,Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends. 
0,Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?
1,I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch. 
1,Yeah.  Maybe you should hit them up on FB for a reunion?
0,I bet you all would live it up and have a blast!
1,I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store. 
1,What did he want?  It's kinda scary when that happens_comma_ you never know what they want.
1,I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy_comma_ did my face get red. 
1,Well a good samaritan after all!  I'm sure you were embarrassed_comma_ but also glad that you didn't lose your purse!
0,My daughter just bought her first car on her own. 
0,Nice! What kind of car is it?
0,It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it. 
0,Well deserved! I hope she enjoys it to the fullest!
0,She is super excited to start school now and show it off. 
0,I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation! 
0,Hey that's awesome!  Where ya goin?
0,We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days. 
0,Holy cow that's awesome!  That's gonna be a fun 10 days!
0,I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year. 
0,Cool!  Have fun and be safe!!
0,My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend_comma_ just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.
0,Yes_comma_ it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus_comma_ we love Blackjack!
1,I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married_comma_ and he didn't care. He sickens me!
1,yikes that is pretty horrible
1,Yes_comma_ I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.
1,just seems so inappropriate and disgusting
0,We went on a vacation a few weeks ago_comma_ and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father_comma_ the last one before he passed away.
0,Oh wow_comma_ I hope you cherished your time with him.
1,I did_comma_ but of course_comma_ wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly_comma_ so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.
0,Sorry that that happened to you_comma_ I hope you're doing well.
1,I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!
1,What did you do with the money/
0,I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But_comma_ I may splurge with it this weekend_comma_ since it was unexpected.
0,That is smart. How often do you play the lottery/
0,My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!
0,I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.
0,That is great. Where is the award displayed?
0,At the department office back at the school.
0,Cool. Will you leave it there forever?
1,One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!
1,Did you get mad at her?
1,Yes_comma_ she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her_comma_ and it was her work! I let her know it too.
1,Hopefully she won't do it again.

1,A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.
1,I know how that feels. Maybe try reaching out.
1,That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.
1,SOmetimes you have to be the bigger person
1,Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.
1,Dang that's really annoying.  Is your insurance going to cover it?
1,Yes_comma_ but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.
1,Yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things.

1,That's terrible. Do you know how long it's been going on?

0,thats a good movie_comma_ cant wait for the live action version coming out
0,Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!
1,Opps. Ok_comma_ i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.

1,Well you can still hang out since its not far
1,I have been having a rough week!
1,Are you glad its over?
1,Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..
1,I am sorry_comma_ any backup options?

1,My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache
1,That's horrible. Did he get to go to the dentist yet?
1,Not yet_comma_ but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.
0,That's very kind of you to be there for him like that. 
1,Ah_comma_ it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.
1,Oh no that's awful. I am sorry for your loss!
1,Thank you_comma_ she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.
1,Yes_comma_ we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that. I have been through it several times. At least they are happy and pain free now.
1,I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out
1,me too. it worries me that all the food will spoil and my animals will get overheated
1,does your power go out alot where you live? it only happens a few times a year here thankfully
1,I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!
1,Wow. Do you remember losing it?
1,No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O
1,There was a huge spider on my wall_comma_ it ran away before I could kill it..

0,Yea_comma_ enought to have great weekened anyway.
0,I cold use some money like that
0,I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.
0,thats awesome to hear_comma_ a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore
0,I know_comma_ I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.
1,i believe so too _comma_ if people are gonna cheat why get married at all
1,Ten years ago now_comma_ a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.
1,That's awful_comma_ but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?
1,Pretty messed up_comma_ but the house was still standing.
1,That's a silver lining in all of it at least! 
1,was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative
1,That's terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?
1,British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting_comma_ they could not
1,I've never trusted British Airways. 
0,I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course_comma_ taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.
0,You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?
0,Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was_comma_ but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful_comma_ it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! 
0,Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.
0,I think it was :)
0,I like going fishing_comma_ it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.
1,Do you have any kids?
0,I do_comma_ I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?
0,I have 3- I bet you can't wait to take him fishing.
1,I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.
1,No_comma_ it was at work.
1,OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?
0,I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it! 
0,That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!
0,Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!
0,I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) 
0,I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!
0,Cool. Do you play football too?
1,I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.
1,Oh no! What did you do?
1,I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.
1,Oh yikes! That's a bummer. I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time_comma_ though.
0,I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.
0,Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.
0,Oh yeah_comma_ definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!
0,That's super great to hear! Well deserved.
1,I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint_comma_ he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!
0,What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.
1,It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier. 
0,Are you goings going to stay friends?
1,I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.
1,Yes_comma_ I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!
1,I hope you get better soon!
1,My transmission in my car went out the other day_comma_ maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.
1,That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst
1,Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too_comma_ so my money is tied up.
0,Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to_comma_ the new house!
1,I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.
1,Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?
1,No_comma_ I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.
1,That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. 
1,Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!
0,Nice. Did you like it?
0,I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary 
0,Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech_comma_ and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!
0,It was who_comma_who were them?
0,I'm sorry if I was unclear_comma_ I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).
0,So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!
0,Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!
0,Yes_comma_ very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.
0,I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! 
1,So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!
1,Oh no! Were you gone for long?
1,We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess
1,What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again
0,I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start
0,I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. 
0,yes very. but I know that it will be good. 
0,I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!
0,Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress
0,You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it
0,I try to be. it can be difficult on some days_comma_ but I think I have a good attitude towards most things
0,I agree_comma_ but having great joy in life helps
0,I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.
0,It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction
0,Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.
1,I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention
0,My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck
0,That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  
0,Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!
0,It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small_comma_ like the company headquarters opening_comma_ can effect an entire town like that
1,So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.
1,Yikes.  Did you get injured?
0,No_comma_ but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.
0,Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.
1,My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.
0,I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!
0,No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!
1,I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!
0,I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!
0,Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car
0,I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.
0,HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best
0,I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.
0,Nice! What genre of playlist was it? 
0,It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado_comma_ 2pac_comma_ etc.
0,Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.
1,My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.
1,I can only imagine! How is he now?
1,They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.
0,Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!
0,I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud_comma_ inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!
0,That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.
1,I just can't wait! I've seen the new place_comma_ and it backs onto a forest_comma_ so there'll be peace there_comma_ at least!
0,It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own
0,Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)
1,I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!
1,oh _comma_ how he reacted next
1,It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.
1,its ok it happens with every one
0,We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone_comma_ especially my brother and sister.
0,Yes_comma_ that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?
0,It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.
0,That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.
0,I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.
0,That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.
0,Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it_comma_ but consistency does seem to pay off.
0,It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.
0,I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.
0,That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?
0,I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though_comma_ I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future
0,You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!
0,My brother got a custom-made bowling ball_comma_ and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.
0,Sounds impressive_comma_ does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?
0,He's on his high school bowling team_comma_ but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.
0,Very nice_comma_ I would be proud too.
1,Ok_comma_ so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!
1,Well_comma_ they were shouting and stomping around_comma_ so I lost it! This morning_comma_ they've been quiet as church mice_comma_ so I guess it worked :)
1,that would really help if it was a permanent solution
1,Yeah_comma_ I really do feel bad_comma_ but it's been going on for over a year.
1,yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.
1,Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up_comma_ lol.
1,bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.
1,I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.
1,I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.
1,No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.
1,That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.
0,I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!
0,That will be an amazing trip!!
0,I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him
0,That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.
0,I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.
1,Christmas was always a nightmare for me.
1,I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.
1,I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.
0,The last time I went into a job interview_comma_ I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.
0,That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!
0,Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.
0,Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?
1,Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!
1,I wasn't sure at first and_comma_ being in a wheelchair_comma_ had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep_comma_ walking her dog!
1,"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!"
0,I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself
0,That's great_comma_ keep it up if you can!
0,I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese
0,It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.
0,My co-worker just bought a brand new car. 
0,Man_comma_ i wish i could get one.
0,I know_comma_ me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.
0,I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.
1,i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are
1,Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. 
1,I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone
1,It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.
0,I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!
0,Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!
0,Not with traffic_comma_ but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there_comma_ so fingers crossed!
0,OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way_comma_ knowing they are causing other people such strife.
0,They're the most selfish_comma_ inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had_comma_ and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.
1,Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?
1,I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.
1,That is horrible! What will you do?
0,i have food on my table_comma_ a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful
0,That is truly all you can ask for.
0,yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted
0,I try to never take anything in life for granted. 
0,so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets
0,Wow_comma_ impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? 
0,thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies
0,You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.
0,I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!
0,I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?
0,Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.
0,I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!
0,Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!
0,When I spend time with my family_comma_ it reminds me how lucky I really am.
0,Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy_comma_ no?
0,Definitely. Even when times get rough_comma_ there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that_comma_ but glad I do now.
0,That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.
0,My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much
0,Dogs really are such great companions_comma_ what breed is she?
0,She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?
0,Yes I have a miniature pinscher_comma_ he just turned 15.
1,School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!
0,how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
0,Oh yes_comma_ I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?
1,the summer is horrid. heat_comma_ sweat_comma_ mosquitos_comma_ rain_comma_ and crowds everywhere
1,I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it
1,I do the same! I think everyone does.
1,yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad
1,I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad
1,I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.
0,That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!
0,I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.
0,Always put your school first_comma_ you will be thankful you did later!
0,My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.
0,Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?
0,Probably some kind of SUV_comma_ maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!
0,That's a really good/safe first car.
0,I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!
0,Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want
0,I want an SUV_comma_ like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!
0,Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!
1,Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off
1,That's annoying_comma_ I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.
1,I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary
1,I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.
0,My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.
1,I can imagine. How old will they be?
0,She will be 30. It makes me feel so old_comma_ but also how fun it was when they were little.
0,Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. 
0,I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I
0,Now that you what? Tell me!
0,Sorry_comma_ I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!
0,Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!
0,I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.
0,That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?
0,Yes_comma_ it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans_comma_ which are delicious!
0,Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?
0,They're the same shape as regular green beans_comma_ but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.
0,I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live_comma_ but this is new to me. 
0,What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange_comma_ different things to try!
0,It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?
1,I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!
1,How did he scare you?
1,Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!
0,I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!
1,My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.
1,Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.
1,I hope he gets that taken care of!
1,When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life_comma_ I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people_comma_ yet was miserable in his own life.
1,I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life_comma_ but in reality_comma_ they are suffering.
1,It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!
1,I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.
1,Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.
1,All around_comma_ it would be a good decision for society. Just last night_comma_ I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed_comma_ he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.
1,There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.
1,I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away
1,Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?
0,Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!
0,How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.
1,I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel_comma_ I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!
1,Wow! That is insane_comma_ too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.
0,Yeah_comma_ for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do_comma_ if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!
0,That sounds like a great time_comma_ one of those nights you always remember!
1,I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.
0,Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.
0,That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.
0,Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
0,That's true - when I was in kindergarten_comma_ we only went for half the day.
1,When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.
0,I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.
0,It feels good to get everything together_comma_ doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!
0,"Yes_comma_ you are correct. You can always ""hope"" for the best_comma_ but also ""plan"" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling."
0,I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.
0,i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please
0,That's wonderful_comma_ they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.
0,he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian
0,Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.
0,A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.
0,Did you think about moving after that?
0,Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time_comma_ lol.
0,haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?
0,No_comma_ moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband_comma_ but we split up.
1,I found a cat in my attic yesterday!
0,Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!
1,My husband is allergic to cats to_comma_ I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!
1,Oh no. That sounds really stressful!
0,My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back_comma_ just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed_comma_ she pulled herself together and made a new_comma_ exciting life her new reality.
0,That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.
0,Yes_comma_ she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there_comma_ she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!
0,Wow_comma_ I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.
0,She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!
0,I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!
0,I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?
0,I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!
0,That's real neat_comma_ I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix_comma_ but Netflix is pretty good too.
1,My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident_comma_ I'm so upset.
1,Aw_comma_ I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!
1,Yes_comma_ we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.
1,Aw_comma_ that's always sad_comma_ I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(
1,I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.
1,That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?
1,Yes_comma_ I heard about it. Such a sad story.
1,That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.
1,My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..
0,That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.
0,I did! It was a very nice gesture.
0,You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!
1,We are waiting on military orders right now_comma_ I'm so hoping they come through next week.
1,Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?
1,Yes_comma_ we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.
0,Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.
1,I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.
1,I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days_comma_ I just don't understand how they could do that.
1,Right_comma_ these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.
1,I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that_comma_ for instance more jail time.
0,For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree_comma_ helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course_comma_ eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.
1,i had a similar experience_comma_ i miss it too
0,It's nice to think back_comma_ tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now_comma_ but the good old days will always remain just that!
0,It's funny_comma_ we always remember the successful_comma_ fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in! 
1,Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.
1,I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out_comma_ it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely_comma_ it wastes a lot of money.
1,Yes_comma_ exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries. 
1,A week!?  That is just crazy_comma_ and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.
0,We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.
0,Texas_comma_ there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change. 
0,I spent some time there_comma_ when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!
0,Awesome_comma_ my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.
1,I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.
0,It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.
0,So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.
0,I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.
0,My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her_comma_ one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!
0,I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!
0,Oh yes_comma_ and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!
0,Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.
1,My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards 
0,That's strange_comma_ I hope she makes it out ok this time though.
1,She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess
0,Oh wow_comma_ I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.
1,Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us
1,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.
1,Yes_comma_ it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult_comma_ so it was really hard when she passed.
1,I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.
1,We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.
0,That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?
0,I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.
0,Well_comma_ it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.
1,I've been so busy packing_comma_ packing and more packing. 
1,That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?
1,Yes_comma_ don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.
0,That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.
0,I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.
0,That is great! You are lucky!
0,I do feel very lucky_comma_ especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.
0,It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.
0,I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.
0,Nice! Which ones did you hear!
0,Mambo #5_comma_ Missy Elliot_comma_ and Ricky Martin. It really took me back
0,That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!
1,I took a test for college the other day_comma_ it was basically our midterm.
1,I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.
0,Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?
0,I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!
0,That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?
0,He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to_comma_ lol!
0,Well yeah_comma_ that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win_comma_ then party time !!!!!
0,You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!
0,It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!
0,Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.
0,I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.
0,That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?
0,There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.
0,I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile_comma_ but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane.
0,There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!
0,Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life
0,Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet they're not laughing when you get them out of a jam!
0,"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared"""
1,It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!
1,You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(
1,Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?
1,Yes_comma_ but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!
1,Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place
1,I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now_comma_ but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!
1,my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out
1,Oh no! Do you know why?
1,yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad
1,Aw_comma_ I'm sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!
1,i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here
1,Do you know he is coming_comma_ or is it just blind luck?
1,i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives
0,That is very considerate of you_comma_ I bet he really appreciates that.
0,i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate
0,Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!
0,yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end
0,What was is your doctorate in?
0,in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience
0,My wife has been out of the country for 2 months_comma_ and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!
0,what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?
0,No_comma_ taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P
1,My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P
1,Ha_comma_ yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.
0,Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad_comma_ but it's nice to come home to a clean house.
0,It always is_comma_ plus it gives you some brownie points as well.
1,i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public
1,I am sorry to hear that_comma_ my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.
1,yeah it is the worst_comma_ i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing 
1,Well_comma_ like I told her_comma_ it will grow out_comma_ it will just take time.
1,I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often_comma_ so it was a bummer.
1,That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?
1,The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.
1,That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.
1,I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.
1,Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up_comma_ or did you try to sneak away?
1,It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.
1,Oh no_comma_ that's really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident.
0,My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.
0,I know you're happy 😊
0,Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)
0,I feel ya_comma_ lonely indeed.
1,I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.
1,That sucks. Why did you move from california?
1,My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway_comma_ a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly_comma_ huh?!
1,That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.
1,The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.
0,The weather is nice in parts of california_comma_ I've been there.
0,The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?
0,My sister got married at Laguna niguel
0,A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip_comma_ but I knew I could do it just fine.
0,That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?
0,It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East_comma_ so kind of knew what I was doing.
0,That's not bad_comma_ I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.
0,Oh no - I'm not a race car driver_comma_ lol. And anyway_comma_ it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country_comma_ so rushing would (to me) be a waste.
1,My wife was really sick the other day_comma_ she was stuck in bed for most of the day.
1,Oh_comma_ poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her_comma_ if you don't mind my asking?
0,Not completely sure_comma_ maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now_comma_ though her appetite took a bit to come back.
0,Well_comma_ I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.
0,summer was so boring for me_comma_ im really happy school is starting again
0,Why was it boring_comma_ nothing exciting to do where you live?
0,not really_comma_ i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did
0,Ah yeah_comma_ that sucks. No time for anything fun.
1,My mom is having weight loss surgery next week_comma_ I'm nervous.
1,What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe_comma_ but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.
1,She is having gastric bypass surgery_comma_ I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!
1,Well_comma_ everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.
1,there is nothing i hate more than losing in something
1,Yeah_comma_ that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?
1,not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me
1,I agree_comma_ it makes you just want to try harder next time.
0,It has been a wonderful Monday!
0,That's great_comma_ what specifically has made it so good for you?
0,I found out a got a pay raise at my job_comma_ we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!
0,Wow that all sounds very exciting_comma_ congratulations!
1,I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(
1,thats so sad oh no! thats terrible. :( 
1,I know_comma_ it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.

1,"I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted_comma_ but since coming to college_comma_ I've been forced to socialize more_comma_ and it's help me at least ""fake it until I make it."" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time_comma_ but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?"
0,that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice. 
0,I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better_comma_ most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down_comma_ too. Good luck
0,I recently went to ruby falls_comma_ an underground cavern with a waterfall. 
0,That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?
1,Not that particular one_comma_ no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.

1,I decided to focus on the music that was blasting_comma_ just tried switching up what I play in the gym_comma_ it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle

1,Yeah I have_comma_ it wasn't serious but I got rearended

1,That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her? 
1,Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals_comma_ and the most recent one was really hard on her.
1,That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss. 
1,"My bank_comma_ which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?"
1,Death by a thousand cuts_comma_ I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!
1,Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.
1,Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.
1,Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!
1,Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.
1,Yes_comma_ I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?
1,Yes_comma_ my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.
1,I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.
1,Have you ever had a new puppy?
1,Yeah_comma_ I have. Do you?
1,Yeah_comma_ he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside_comma_ but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!
1,It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.
1,I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there
1,Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.
1,Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone! 
1,Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it's gone. Do you know who ate it?
1,I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.
1,Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?
1,I agree_comma_ I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it_comma_ I went out and confessed.
1,i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month
1,I know how you feel_comma_ financial problems are rough. I know you'll figure out a way to make it.
1,thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive

1,Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.
1,That is very true! Was it bad weather?

0,My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day_comma_ but I never believed him. 
0,Why don't you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.
0,I don't know if he was famous_comma_ but the other day_comma_ he got on stage_comma_ bit the head off of a bat_comma_ then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!
0,Wow_comma_ that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!
1,I used to do flooring work_comma_ we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes. 
1,That sounds interesting.  What kinds?
1,well_comma_ one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.
1,It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box
1,Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?
1,I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it_comma_ it still happens
1,That's kinda strange. I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?
0,I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.
0,Wow_comma_ that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?
0,It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut_comma_ but it looks much thicker and healthier now.
0,And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!
1,I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants_comma_ right on my bottom.
1,Ahhhh! I've done that before_comma_ but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?
1,Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it. 
1,That's embarrassing_comma_ ah_comma_ I'm sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work! 
1,I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.
1,Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.
1,I would've happily taken that! Instead_comma_ it was filled with literal garbage_comma_ like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.
1,"Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but ""literal garbage"" is pretty funny. That sucks_comma_ can you report them to eBay?"
0,I had my final exam for Chemistry today!
0,I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.
0,That's good. I was never good at chemistry
1,It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone

0,well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?
1,Haha_comma_ yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up_comma_ someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.
0,hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like
1,I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off
1,I do hate when the lights are off too

0,I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.

1,When I was a teenager_comma_ I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!
1,Sometimes things like these happens. Don't worry. But playing hookey is a fun though
1,Sometimes I enjoy being alone_comma_ but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.
1,I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?
1,This was a while back_comma_ but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally_comma_ he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.
0,That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? 
1,I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.
1,on to the next one_comma_ as they say!

1,have the new chick there when she comes home
1,I just watched the ring movie for the first time.
1,Oh yeah.  I've never seen it_comma_ I can't watch horror films.  How did you like it?
1,I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.
1,Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.

1,Some people DO die from choking_comma_ be safe!
1,My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.

0,I started taping my mouth closed before bed_comma_ and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up_comma_ feels like I am born again
0,That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does_comma_ I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?
0,Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?
0,I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin
0,Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.
0,That sounds like a nice time!

1,Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?
1,No_comma_ I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible
1,Well_comma_ I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.
1,I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!
1,I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.
1,That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card_comma_ and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!
1,Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!

1,I can't believe I am telling you this_comma_ but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.
1,Thats not strange at all
1,I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is_comma_ when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!
1,That sucks. What did you do?
1,My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving_comma_ she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.
1,Oh no_comma_ the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?
1,Unfortunately_comma_ it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead_comma_ I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.
0,You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time_comma_ right?
1,My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking_comma_ but ultimately underwhelming thing
1,hahaha why was it underwhelming?
1,I guess because furry things don't really scare me_comma_ I was like well that was a waste of a reaction
1,lol how do you feel about spiders?
1,I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift
1,Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?
1,No not really_comma_ just seeing how much energy I could summon from within
1,I see_comma_  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation
1,There's too many things to think about
0,You are good at generalizing aren't you?
0,Yeah_comma_ what am I getting myself into
1,I have no clue.. really I don't!

1,Oh_comma_ that had to be super gross! 
1,I was walking down the street at night_comma_ I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.

0,Well_comma_ there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.
1,One time_comma_ I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.
1,That's strange. What did you discover under there?
1,Well_comma_ when I went to lift the engine cover_comma_ I noticed a dead_comma_ rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.
1,Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!

0,I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.
0,"Oh yeah? Is it on par with ""I Have a Dream""?"
1,I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.

0,Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.
0,wow that was really nice of them
0,Yeah_comma_ I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.

1,I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.
0,That's great_comma_ man! Did you study hard for it?
0,I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.

1,I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.
1,Oh that's terrible.  Is he alright?

1,That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?
0,I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.

1,I left my wallet in a movie theater_comma_ and didn't notice till I was half way home!
1,That's terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?
1,I was able to get back in and find it_comma_ it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.

0,Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.
0,I agree. I think I am one of them_comma_ considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.

0,That's really great_comma_ but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it_comma_ I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.

0,That's good to hear_comma_ what did she do to make you proud?
1,She performed her first solo dance in competition_comma_ but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.

1,I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.
1,Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?
1,The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents_comma_ so the dump has a line every day.
1,That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!
1, We have_comma_ and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words_comma_it has to be corrected.
1,'s all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.
1,Oh really? What was it they served?
1,"I should have known better_comma_ as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!"
1,Oh wow... I really can't imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.
1,I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.
1,my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.

0,Thank you_comma_ I have a good feeling about it.
0,I went to a wedding recently_comma_ and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy_comma_ but at least he knows he can trust me.
0,Oh no_comma_ it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.
1,Yeah_comma_ his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up_comma_ and let him know what had happened.
1,Yikes. Well_comma_ at least you did the right thing by passing that long_comma_ as painful as it might have been.

1,It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back
0,The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I_comma_ as we love craft beer. Until recently_comma_ our town didn't have one though.
0,I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?
0,We actually don't brew our own_comma_ and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!
0,Awesome_comma_ that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!
1,I hate it when other guys look at my girl
1,ooh_comma_ you should not be_comma_ she should be appreciated for looking good

1,"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential""_comma_ or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year."
1,Oh_comma_ I haven't read it_comma_ but I was also sad to hear he passed
1,He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food_comma_ and we all still look up to him.
1,Yes_comma_ too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help
1,My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.
0,Aw_comma_ that's so nice of them! Was it fun?

1,I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!
1,How long have you been there ?
1,About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.
0,Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.
0,Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!
1,Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday_comma_ so I had to work overtime_comma_ but I didn't even get paid for it!
1,That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?
1,I'm technically salaried_comma_ so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating. 
1,It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.
1,I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it
1,Wow_comma_ did you ever get them in trouble?
1,Sadly_comma_ no.  There's no actual proof of who it was_comma_ but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once_comma_ so I'll take that as a victory.
1,There you go_comma_ take victories where you can get them!

1,My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt_comma_ and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him_comma_ but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is
1,Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end_comma_ but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.
0,Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.
0,A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.
0,That sounds like so much fun!
1,I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France_comma_ Italy_comma_ Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!

0,I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!
1,When I interviewed for the job I have now_comma_ they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.
1,That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.
1,It worked out ok_comma_ but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.
1,Well_comma_ at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.
1,My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.
1,Aw_comma_ I bet you miss her a lot.
1,I do.  She's getting back soon_comma_ but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.
0,Well_comma_ at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though.
1,When I interviewed for my current job_comma_ I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.
1,What kind of job is it?
0,A lab technician at a university.
0,Interesting! What kind of things do you do?
1,My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.

1,"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair."
1,well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol
1,My wife has been out of the country for two months_comma_ which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.
1,She gets back in a week_comma_ so it's almost over.
1,my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty
1,Did you go running like crazy!? 
1,heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work
1,i would have done the same glad no one got stung! 
1,i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season
1,They are bad now too_comma_ they are so annoying

1,It can be irritating to deal with this time of year
1,Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders_comma_ but she made me kill a huge one yesterday. 
1,Come on_comma_ the worst that can happen is that it kills you.
1,Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!
1,It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.
0,I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!
0,Wow_comma_ are you nervous at all
0,A little bit_comma_ but I love doing extreme stuff like this.
0,That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.
1,The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night! 
1,That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well_comma_ at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!
1,It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs! 
1,I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me_comma_ that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot_comma_ so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!
1,On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.
0,Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? 
1,Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.
0,I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! 
0,You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still_comma_ I fret about it. I should just get on with it!
0,I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack 
0,That's a good friend you got there.
0,she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her
0,Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.
1,Cell phones are great_comma_ but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.
1,What types of situations are you referring to?
1,Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline_comma_ and it was not an appropriate topic!
1,lol_comma_ did everyone around you make funny faces?
1,Of course they did_comma_ some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated_comma_lol.
1,My dog died today :(
1,I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?
0,Yes_comma_ she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.

0,I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!
0,That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?

0,Well_comma_ she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!
1,I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!
1,Could you elaborate as to why?
1,I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!

0,for this specific game for about 3 months
0,Wow_comma_ that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!

0,That sounds like a relief.
0,It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.
0,It seems like it's a lot of ruckus_comma_ I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. 
0,That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!
0,Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.
0,Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.
0,Oh_comma_ good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.
1,I went to work with my pants inside out_comma_ and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.
1,Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O 
1,It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.
1,thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha 
1,The airport was completely empty the other day.
1,that is awesome_comma_ i hope that happens to me on my next trip_comma_ where where you going
1,Home_comma_ but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am_comma_ it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.

0,college_comma_ but i will be seeing him very soon i think

1,Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
1,hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea
1,Its the only way to get them to learn

0,That's wonderful_comma_ it's always good when hard work pays off like that!
0,Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.

1,Yes_comma_ and to make it worse_comma_ when I tried to clean it_comma_ she tried to eat_comma_ so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.
1,I hope she didn't eat too much of it_comma_ it might make her sick.
1,No_comma_ she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.
1,There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it 
1,Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?
1,I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive_comma_ small_comma_ and bland! 
1,That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.
1,In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.
1,That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations
1,If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument_comma_ but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.
1,If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.
1,I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee_comma_ lol. I'm all for earnest discussion_comma_ but not at work!

1,That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.
1,yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about
1,I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.
1,A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer_comma_ but he got a job and had to cancel.
1,Aw_comma_ that sucks. But at least he got a job_comma_ right?
1,Yeah_comma_ and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him_comma_ but would have really liked to see him.

1,My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday_comma_ we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe_comma_ have fun_comma_ and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call_comma_ we found out that she had a heart attack and died.  
1,Oh my. That is very unfortunate.
1,Yes_comma_ it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013_comma_ and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.
1,I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.
1,My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. 
1,That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats_comma_ is because they're so independent_comma_ and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.
1,I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad
1,Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.
0,I love to play golf_comma_ but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.
0,My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport_comma_ albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming_comma_ and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.
0,It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you_comma_ too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!
1,Well_comma_ often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself_comma_ at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens_comma_ motivation starts to become real easy to get.
1,Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch_comma_ lol.
0,Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!
0,I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience_comma_ but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.

0,Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?

0,I am_comma_ I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies. 
1,I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face! 
1,That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.
1,I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! 
1,How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.
1,I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything
0,Well_comma_ it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?
0,a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job_comma_ they pay really good money
0,I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck
0,I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.
1,Did you tell anyone about the dream?
0,I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.
1,You should call your best friend on the telephone!
1,I actually sent her a message through facebook.

0,oh that sounds like fun
0,Yeah_comma_ he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. 
0,sounds like a wonderful day!
0,It is_comma_ a day I will always remember. I named him spot_comma_ because he has a funny looking spot on his back. 
1,I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved_comma_ it was sold out everywhere_comma_ except Ebay. The problem was_comma_ the price was doubled.
1,Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. 
1,I may buy it still_comma_ but I have to save up more money now.
1,Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. 
1,I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.
1,I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!
1,It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.
1,It was sheer greed_comma_ I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments_comma_ but I really shouldn't have done that.
1,Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it_comma_ haha.
1,It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!
1,my son is sick_comma_ he got this hand foot and mouth desease_comma_ nothing serious but he has a fever
1,i know_comma_ i got some motrin_comma_ funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow
0,i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions
0,That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?
1,honestly_comma_ no_comma_ it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again
1,Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.
0,I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.
0,I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf_comma_ I always found it really boring_comma_ but if you enjoy it then great!
0,I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that_comma_ if you don't play_comma_ it would be pretty boring!
0,Oh that totally changes things I guess_comma_ makes sense.
0,I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments_comma_ in that teams are playing against each other.
1,Last Christmas Eve_comma_ after a family event_comma_ I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him_comma_ and it had hurt her feelings.
1,Aw that's terrible_comma_ at least you were able to comfort her?
1,Yes_comma_ I was able to make her feel better_comma_ and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out_comma_ and I was ready to confront some people.
1,I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.
1,I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it! 
1,Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?
1,I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden! 
1,LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.
1,I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!
1,Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. 
1,They're filthy_comma_ ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison_comma_ without parole!!!
1,Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. 
1,More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.
1,Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I. 
1,Oh_comma_ I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?
1,It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. 
1,I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.
1,It would be_comma_ I worry for the safety of my family. 
0,My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.
0,You do? thats good_comma_ friends can be terrible people to lend too.
0,They can_comma_ but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan_comma_ so I reckon I'll be ok there.
0,I bet he pays you in full.
1,Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.
1,My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first 
0,I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?
0,He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! 
0,Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. 
1,Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first_comma_ especially if it's in the early morning_comma_ like 3am or something.
1,Does it look like a space ship?
1,Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it_comma_ and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?
1,I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time
1,i love my friend_comma_ she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes
1,like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat
1,Wow_comma_ I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying
1,It is so difficult to have a pet pass away_comma_ I really miss him.
1,Aw I understand that_comma_ I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? 
1,Over the summer_comma_ he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.
1,Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? 
1,A border collie_comma_ he was a great doggie.
1,My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.
1,Oh no_comma_ have you been able to calm yourself down?
1,She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.
1,I can understand that_comma_ I think I would be a mess too.
1,I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.
1,That does not sound plpeasant at all_comma_ maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.
1,I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay_comma_ but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.
1,Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?
0,I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.
0,I bet you are_comma_ that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?
1,I did_comma_ two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.
0,How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency_comma_ and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous_comma_ and proud in a vicarious kind of way.
0,I was_comma_ and happy to have water_comma_ granola bars_comma_ and an extra cell phone charger!
0,I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.
0,Well good luck with that!
0,Thank you_comma_ I have been compiling  data for 5 years_comma_ my brain is totally absorbed by it.
1,I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.
0,Do roller coasters scare you
0,I think it was just the thought of being so high up.
1,I used to be afriad of heights too
1,I had to stay home and work_comma_ while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.
1,That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.
1,Hopefully_comma_ but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.
0,Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.
1,In some ways_comma_ losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent_comma_ they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.
1,Goodness_comma_ you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.
1,Exactly_comma_ and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago_comma_ I honestly thought I would die too.
1,I'm so very sorry for your loss_comma_ I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.
1,Thank you_comma_ that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.
0,A week before my cruise this summer_comma_ I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.
0,It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way_comma_ unfortunately.
0,Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!
0,That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!
0,When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped. 
0,And how is she doing now
0,She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade
0,That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need
1,I finally had a day of_comma_ but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.
1,aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!
1,I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.
1,bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!
1,I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious
1,Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.
1,That isn't good at all_comma_ glad you didn't have an accident. 
1,I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes
1,Did you find any good companies.
0,a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is
1,Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.
1,I just ate a whole cake by myself_comma_ I feel sick!
1,It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!
1,Thank you_comma_ being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. 
1,I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it_comma_ just try better tomorrow.
1,The other night I had a panic attack out the blue 
1,That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?
1,Sadly no_comma_ I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. 
1,Are you able to do anything to prevent them?
1,I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.
1,I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.
1,We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.
1,Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. 
1,We will have to go there next_comma_ hopefully he is chilling there. 
1,I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months_comma_ and everything was fine. Then...nothing.
1,Aww_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?
1,"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay_comma_ thanks for the memories. But it was rough."
1,That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.
0,Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice_comma_ I was so thankful because money has been tight.
0,How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward_comma_ as the saying goes.
0,I will_comma_ you never know when someone else is in need! 
0,It is_comma_ I have been so blessed in my life! 
0,My husband started college this week!
0,How exciting_comma_ is he a non-traditional student?
0,Yes_comma_ he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!
0,That is really good_comma_ speaking from experience_comma_ all military men and women should get a degree.
1,I am a really picky eater_comma_ and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.
1,Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.
1,No poisoning_comma_ but my burger had a long hair in it_comma_ so I couldn't eat it.
1,Oh gosh_comma_ that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right_comma_ and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
1,So gross_comma_ that is certain.
1,I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air
1,Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.
1,I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards 
1,Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing_comma_ coffee on light colors stinks!
1,Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid_comma_ I was really frightened the other night.
1,I went for a drink downstairs_comma_ and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night_comma_lol.
1,Oh man! I would have been so scared! 
1,I really was_comma_ and I'm supposed to be the grown up_comma_ but I got my daughter to lie next to me.
1,My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!
1,Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?
1,People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing_comma_ it gets so annoying! 
1,Yeah_comma_ that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.
0,I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.
0,I do that all the time_comma_ no big deal.
0,I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.
0,What kind of pizza did you eat?
0,When I got my first paycheck with a bonus_comma_ I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!
0,That is such a relief_comma_ it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. 
0,Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat_comma_ so it really was a relief_comma_ like you said.
0,Oh yeah_comma_ retirement will come before you know it_comma_ it is good to be prepared! 
0,Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!
0,Oh wow_comma_ now that really is exciting_comma_ congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?
1,I am teaching at a small private school_comma_ so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited_comma_ just nervous. 
0,Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!
0,It really is_comma_ you are molding their future! 
1,I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce
1,That sucks_comma_ will she not let you see the dog at all?
1,No we are not on speaking terms_comma_ It's pretty unfair_comma_ thankfully we didn't have a kid together.
1,Yes_comma_ that is probably a positive.
1,Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.
1,Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!
1,They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.
1,Man that sounds really stressful...
1,It is_comma_ to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.
0,My sister got a promotion at work last week!
0,oh that is awesome. what does she do?
0,She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)
0,that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.
0,My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit_comma_ and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud_comma_ like a dad_comma_ even though we're roughly the same age.
0,Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.
0,Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.
0,I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!
1,My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!
0,don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure
1,I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him_comma_ just not used to not being there with him.
0,i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.
1,Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?
0,it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see
0,Cant wait to see what he can do_comma_  Its exciting too!  
0,it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.
0,I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.
0,I remember that console_comma_ that's old school.
0,It sure is now_comma_ but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.
0,Those were the good old days!
1,I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.
1,are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?
1,I found a study group_comma_ I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.
1,thats good.. well you are on your way up!
1,Hopefully_comma_ I don't even understand how others get all A's.
1,I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made! 
0,Thats awesome_comma_ can we trade?
1,Haha my husband plays video games as well_comma_ but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.
0,That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready_comma_ unlike mine
1,Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!
1,Not only did I have a rough morning because of it_comma_ but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.
1,Hmm_comma_ that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.
1,Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon_comma_ they carry something in their nails/claws.
1,Really_comma_ my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five_comma_ scared the poop out of me
1,My son wanted one of those once_comma_ but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one_comma_lol.
0,I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday
0,Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult_comma_ I'm glad that it is working for you.
0,Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts_comma_ good thing I'm not allergic
0,I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am
0,That is fantastic. Any good new lately?
0,Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life! 
0,That is an amazing feeling. 
1,I had such a bad cold last week_comma_ I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.
1,did you go to the doctor
1,No_comma_ thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still_comma_ I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.
1,No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it_comma_ my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!
1,Well_comma_ did you eat her ice cream?
1,I certainly would have liked to_comma_ but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it_comma_ I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.
1,I wonder who actually ate it then.
1,She probably did_comma_ during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am_comma_ drunk_comma_ with some random guy she brought home from the club.
1,So are you saying it could be the guy?
1,Either he ate it_comma_ or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it_comma_ and I'm about to hulk out!
1,I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week_comma_ and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.
1,You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.
0,I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books_comma_ and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.
0,Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. 
0,I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome
0,That would be pretty cool to see_comma_ but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you_comma_ did it?
0,I attacked it with some pets_comma_ it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing
0,Ahh_comma_ okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still_comma_ that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!
0,I'm taking my midterm exam this week_comma_ and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot_comma_ and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!
1,Nice_comma_ I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared_comma_ but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever
0,That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course_comma_ and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.
0,Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal
1,I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her_comma_ seeing all that stuff.
0,i bet it does bud_comma_ I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it
1,Well_comma_ I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason_comma_ and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it_comma_ you know?
0,yes i know_comma_ good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.
1,Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.
1,sometimes they cant avoid it 
1,I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!
1,I understand_comma_ but coming at me head on_comma_ on a two lane highway_comma_ while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.
1,I cant imagine how scared you must have been.
1,Uh oh_comma_ did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.
1,Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?
1,I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!
1,Oh god. Was it big?
1,Yes_comma_ im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.
1,Well_comma_ maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.
0,I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.
0,Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young_comma_ so she has a way to go_comma_ but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.
1,I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems_comma_ but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise. 
0,Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?
0,I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life_comma_ and she's always been supportive.
0,Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!
1,I have some bad news_comma_ unfortunately. Well_comma_ bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.
1,I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?
0,It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health_comma_ and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.
0,Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!
0,Thank you so much for being supportive. :)
1,I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.
1,Did you find out what happened?
1,Not a chance! I was too scared to go out_comma_ and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.
1,Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?
1,Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that_comma_ no way jose.
1,I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.
0,did it turn out ok ?
1,Seems to have_comma_ yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year_comma_ but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.
1,hopes he continues to get better
1,Yes_comma_ hopefully he does_comma_ because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely_comma_ not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.
1,I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...
1,I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.
1,I might look into that_comma_ thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore_comma_ it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids_comma_ is a big one.
1,I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus_comma_ it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody_comma_com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!
0,Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly
0,Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?
0,Super smash bros is a classic_comma_ never gets old_comma_ but yeah you're right
1,I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
1,I had a job interview recently
1,Oh_comma_ how did it go?
1,Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.
1,I'm sorry_comma_ I am sure you will be ready next time.
1,Speaking of co-workers_comma_ one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes_comma_ and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.
0,Wait_comma_ why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!
1,Yeah_comma_ yeah_comma_ yeah. Amazing and all_comma_ but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.
1,I think you need to look at the bigger picture_comma_ though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
1,I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me
0,What movie did you see
0,Jurassic World. It was okay.
1,Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest
1,I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.
1,Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?
1,Yeah_comma_ he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge. 
1,Damn well_comma_ he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.
1,I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones
1,It is indeed unfair_comma_ they shouldn't have done that
1,I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms
1,you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!
1,I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom_comma_ but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain
1,I bet that was awkward
1,I guess that happens sometimes_comma_ did you finish the game
1,My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!
1,That is terrible and a little odd!
1,Yeah_comma_ tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men_comma_ but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!
1,Wait_comma_ you were ok with her cheating?
1,Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl_comma_ and I was stupid enough to believe her.
0,I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.
0,Yes indeed! what did you do?
1,I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.
0,You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!
1,Speaking of kids in school_comma_ I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.
1,That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!
1,No no_comma_ see_comma_ it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average_comma_ I guess. :(
1,Oh_comma_ I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know_comma_ he could turn it around next year and blow you away!
1,He seemed fine about it_comma_ which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.
0,So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?
0,Wow_comma_ is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.
0,I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though_comma_ and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay_comma_ we get it_comma_ you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant_comma_ cool.
0,Wow_comma_ that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!
0,I mean_comma_ let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs_comma_ I knew I had that thing in the bag.
0,Dang_comma_ that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound_comma_ you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.
0,Ah_comma_ I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned_comma_ however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!
0,How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out_comma_ friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!
0,Hmph. Well_comma_ you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42_comma_ section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.
0,I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though
0,That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?
0,Yes_comma_ I feel much better now.
0,That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.
0,I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.
0,That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.
0,Yes_comma_ it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time_comma_ before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh_comma_ I do miss her though. She was just the best!
0,Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?
0,I'm just saying I respect her life choices_comma_ but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.
1,My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.
1,That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!
1,I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.
1,Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!
0,Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.
0,Holy moses_comma_ he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.
0,Child's play is right_comma_ the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have_comma_ because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large_comma_ which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.
0,Yeah_comma_ that's what they tell everyone because_comma_ in reality_comma_ they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.
1,I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.
1,Ahh_comma_ that's too bad_comma_ did you mention it to your boss?
0,My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions_comma_ probably a bad idea. 
1,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!
1,My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.
1,I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.
1,Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected. 
1,I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.
1,I broke up with my boyfriend last week_comma_ and nothing is the same without him.
1,Time will make it better. You just have to move on.
1,Yeah_comma_ I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.
1,Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.
0,I just made the most delicious pie
0,Really? What kind was it?
0,It was apple pit_comma_  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.
0,Oh I love apple pie with ice cream_comma_ it's such a good combination
0,I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.
0,Nice_comma_ I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.
0,I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's
0,How much did you pay for them?
0,I just went camping and build the warmest fire.
0,I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.
0,Yeah_comma_ I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.
0,Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.
1,I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.
1,That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.
1,I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.
1,Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.
1,I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai
0,These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic 
0,That is true but Dubai is a bit better
1,I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.
1,Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?
0,Of course_comma_ I'm not worried no one would steal from me.
0,You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.
1,I can't help feel stressed about money
1,why? are you having financial problems?
1,Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700
1,oh god _comma_ that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!
1,I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family
1,Oh no_comma_ what did you do to stay cheerful ?
1,lol I played xbox games
0,Sounds good_comma_ when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?
0,I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems. 
0,what kind of health problems ?
0,Blood pressure and crohns disease_comma_ as well as_comma_ a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well_comma_ woke up happy and energized
0,i'm glad you feel good today!
1,You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions_comma_ and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.
0,lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!
0,Ahh_comma_ then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard_comma_ people.
0,And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!
0,Actually a genius_comma_ I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were_comma_ did we?
1,I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.
0,That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.
1,I'm hoping for the best_comma_ but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!
1,Amen_comma_ me too.   I hate my current job.
0,This is going to sound really pathetic_comma_ but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!
0,It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house
0,Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.
0,I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good
0,Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks_comma_ so I want it to be really clean.
0,My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.
0,That's good. I know that would be difficult.
0,She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha
0,That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!
0,I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.
0,That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year_comma_ I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put_comma_ even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?
1,Not really_comma_ but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!
1,Oh yeah_comma_ I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily_comma_ if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment_comma_ so even if they did make noise_comma_ I couldn't hear them over it!
0,Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.
1,Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.
0,Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?
0,It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. 
0,That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!
0,Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.
1,Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?
0,Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!
0,It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean_comma_ I love my life right now_comma_ but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.
1,I agree and time jut goes by too fast!
1,I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.
0,Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?
1,As much as I can_comma_ but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.
1,Exhaust all options_comma_ social media is a big way to stay connected
0,Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently_comma_ one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me_comma_ without my saying anything!
0,Wow!  What was in the package?
0,It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled_comma_ so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries_comma_ so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.
0,That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.
0,The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!
1,My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh_comma_ i miss her so much
0,Nice do you still keep in touch with her
1,yes but she lives in a different country_comma_ different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer
0,Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her
0,For me_comma_ one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.
0,What book do you enjoy reading?
0,Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?
0,No_comma_ actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.
0,There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.
1,My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!
1,Where is your home village?
1,In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place_comma_ and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!
1,"That's a shame. I""m sorry to hear that."
1,Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day_comma_ but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.
1,Do you live in the United States now?
1,Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.
1,Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.
0,i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need
0,I love dogs! What breed is he?
0,he is a french puddle and i love him very much
0,That's so sweet! We have blue healers_comma_ they just make the world better.
1,"One time as a surprise for my birthday_comma_ my college friends ""kidnapped me"""
1,Oh my goodness_comma_ that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.
1,Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).
0,Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?
0,Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.
1,i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street_comma_ i get really angry and sad at the same time
1,Do you ever offer to help thm?
1,yes i go to my local charity every weekend
1,GOod for you_comma_ I feel bad for never helping out.
0,I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.
0,Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.
0,I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much. 
1,Don't spend it all in one place :)
1,I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)
0,Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet._comma_
1,I was really lonely and depressed at one point_comma_ and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.
1,Haha_comma_ that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment_comma_ how are you feeling recently?
1,Much better_comma_ thanks :)  Yeah_comma_ I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.
1,I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.
1,I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!
1,Oh my_comma_ you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.
1,I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him 
1,Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.
0,I was confident that I was going to win that prize
0,What prize was it_comma_ or what was the competition_comma_ rather? I'm interested to know_comma_ but don't want to pry_comma_ if you don't feel like saying.
0,It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok
0,Ah_comma_ gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things_comma_ myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.
1,We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap
1,It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was 
1,Sometimes the cheap things are the best
1,it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother
1,I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover
1,yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital
1,i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive
0,I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents

0,I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag_comma_ gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch_comma_ and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.
0,That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse_comma_ yours may have talent.
1,He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.
0,That's really cool_comma_ it makes me want to consider getting a dog.
0,I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good
0,what did she do ?
0,We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents
0,wow that was nice of her

0,Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time_comma_ lol.

1,That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?
1,It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.
1,Ooh_comma_ that would be aggravating. I guess there isn't much you can do.
1,I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.
0,I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid
0,Best of luck! What are you bidding for
0,I am bidding on a rare comic book
1,I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.
1,Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?
1,Thankfully not really_comma_ it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it_comma_ but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.
1,Thank goodness. I'd be scared_comma_ too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.
0,it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days
0,It has_comma_ what did you see that impressed you?
0,well the phones are basically a 1990's computer
0,They're more powerful than that. More like an early 2000's computer.
1,I ate an entire cake last night 
1,What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?
1,It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating 
1,Ok_comma_ at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.
0,I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it
0,That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?
0,Ehh_comma_ its not the best but it's not bad either\
0,It's good just to have enough these days.
1,I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater

0,That's good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love 
0,Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well_comma_ I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.
0,wow even organic store? that's pretty cool
0,I find it hard to believe_comma_ myself! This is the rural south_comma_ yet there are fine dining restaurants_comma_ the aforementioned store_comma_ really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.
1,i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up
1,Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?
1,because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know_comma_ such a yucky feeling
1,Well_comma_ most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally_comma_ I can't stand cigar smoke_comma_ but some people love it! I guess in your case_comma_ you need to scrape the food off the plate first.
1,i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor
1,I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!
1,yeah they even have a bin specially for that
1,i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it
1,Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.
1,yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things
1,It can be really dangerous too
1,I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard
1,That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?
1,Thank goodness it was dead_comma_ poor thing is not suffering_comma_ but some people can be so cruel.
1,That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house_comma_ too.  Do you know who it was?
1,We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.
1,What's been holding you back?
0,It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though
0,That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.
0,Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven_comma_ heaven_comma_ heaven!
0,That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?
0,About once a week. Her husband works in the store_comma_ so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!
0,I have never tried making Indian food myself_comma_ but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.  
0,Well_comma_ my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook_comma_ and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!
0,I have been working on  my jump shot all month.

0,I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.
0,That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off
1,One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.
1,Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?
1,Not until about 8am_comma_ but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!
1,So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!
1,Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!
1,I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!
1,How many times do you need to tell them!? :(
1,Nothing in life is certain_comma_ the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.
0,I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty_comma_ that God will bless them despite circumstances. 
1,I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.

0,It will. I am sure of it.
1,I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..

1,Absolutely. Yet_comma_ these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you_comma_ even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.
1,You'd hope folks would grow up_comma_ but sometimes people get set in their ways_comma_ and become impossible to change.
1,I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online_comma_ but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.
1,Oh no_comma_ what did they say? 
1,They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish_comma_ and it makes me very anxious.
1,That is really creepy_comma_ I would feel anxious too. I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages_comma_Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)
1,I'm going rock climbing with some friends!
1,That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.

0,That's great! All the hard work is paying off.
0,I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.
0,Congrats_comma_ that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.
0,It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty_comma_ but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.

0,I hope you're able to find some friends in the next semester then!
1,This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.
1,Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?
1,I'm not sure. The more I think about it_comma_ the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby_comma_ so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.
1,Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. 
0,I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.
0,That is great to here!

0,My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious
1,Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself_comma_ or because you don't have a wealthy husband?

0,That's hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?

1,When my wife left me_comma_ i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest_comma_ I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic 
0,I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.

1,My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork_comma_ like 70 plus hours a week.
1,I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?
1,He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.

1,My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it_comma_ we've been getting along great since we broke up.

1,One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek_comma_ my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble_comma_ and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.
1,Oh no_comma_ I bet your parents were freaking out.
1,Yeah I guess they were_comma_ they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin_comma_ even though I was 7 and it was his idea. 
1,Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.
1,So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.
1,Do you get much use out of it_comma_ or is it just collection dust?
1,Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.
1,I guess you can hang on to it_comma_ or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.
0,One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.

1,Oh no_comma_ I am sure they meant no harm_comma_ they always say that they are more curious when they are young. 
1,Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me_comma_ because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.
1,It will pass in time_comma_ even though it feels awful right now.

0,Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)
0,What did y'all do? Did you do anything special that evening? 
1,I went to the zoo last month_comma_ I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos_comma_ however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.
1,Oh_comma_ I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid.
1,The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it. 
1,Yeah_comma_ it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.
0,I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!

1,When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th_comma_ he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.
1,Wow_comma_ really? Did you have any feelings for him? 
1,No_comma_ the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.
1,Hahaha_comma_ that is so cute_comma_ I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! 
0,I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field

0,o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?
0,Moving_comma_ not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.
1,Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. 
1,Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.
1,Oh no that is terrible_comma_ I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? 
1,Huge dent_comma_ I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.
1,Wow_comma_ that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it_comma_ because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.
0,I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.
0,Aww were you excited when you picked her up?

1,I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.
1,Oh my god_comma_ you should have reported her.
1,I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.

1,I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.
1,Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!
1,So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.
1,I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting_comma_ but its better than throwing up in the car right ?
1,Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.

1,"When I go out to a restaurant_comma_ I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not_comma_ my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill."
1,What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.
1,If it's mild_comma_ just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say_comma_ eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten_comma_ my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!

0,Nothing worse than a bad soda! lol.  I like the new Freestyle machines_comma_ it's always just right.
0,"While cleaning out our closets_comma_ I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!"

0,I bet she is a great cook!
0,I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend_comma_ but I hope he keeps it a secret!
0,That sounds exciting! Is he good at keeping secrets?

0,Fingers crossed for you!  I'm sure it will be fine.  Are you nervous?

0,Time goes by so fast. You'll see. 
1,Yeah_comma_ or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big. 
0,LOL_comma_ well there is always luck!
1,I am in the process of potty training my daughter_comma_ but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day_comma_ we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.
1,I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.
1,It was not one of our best moments. Luckily_comma_ she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.
1,THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!

Last week_comma_ during revival_comma_ for the first few nights_comma_ everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit_comma_ but I couldn't for whatever reason_comma_ and it made me feel bad.
0,Oh_comma_ I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.
0,Yes_comma_ I prayed about it multiple times_comma_ and by the last night_comma_ I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.
0,That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.

1,Interesting_comma_ are you feeling OK having less bonding time?
1,Yeah_comma_ it's just too quiet lol.
0,I see_comma_ I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby_comma_ or school ends for the day.
1,Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.
1,That's not very fun. I hate traveling like that.
1,Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.
1,At least you got to see your family for a little bit.
1,That is true_comma_ I guess there is that to be thankful for.
1,I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!
1,Ew_comma_ that's always the worst. What were you getting?
1,Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.
1,That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.
1,I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.
1,Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?
1,I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.

0,I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer
0,I am!  I would love to go myself.
1,Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100%.
0,My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.
0,I bet it is! I love getting together with friends_comma_ especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get.
1,Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.
1,I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?
1,No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.
0,Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!
1,My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.
1,Hahaha_comma_ yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.
1,I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.
1, I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe_comma_ lol.
1,This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.
1,Yikes_comma_ that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?
1,No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.
1,That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?
1,No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.
1,Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.
1,I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently_comma_ but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.
1,I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.
1,We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.
1,Yeah_comma_ I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.
0,The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes_comma_ shoes_comma_ and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.

0,I'm home with my toddler_comma_ so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.
0,For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.
1,Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.
1,Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?
1,Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.
0,I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)
1,My husband's grandfather recently passed away_comma_ and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.
1,Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad
1,It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him_comma_ while he was sick_comma_ about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.
1,Oh that's awful and borderline abusive
1,Yes_comma_ the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.
0,Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.

0,It will be a blast_comma_ I just love roughing it in the outdoors!
1,The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house_comma_ i was pretty scared. 
1,Wow_comma_ that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?
1,No_comma_ it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating. 
1,I'm glad everything turned out okay!
0,It has been raining a lot lately_comma_ I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.

1,No_comma_ I ended up just suffering through it and eating it. 
1,you are a lot bravery than I_comma_ I do't think i could it eat
1,Yeah_comma_ I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me. 
0,I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently_comma_ I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.
0,Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking 
0,Yea_comma_ it made me feel better about myself and my chances_comma_ or maybe i just like spending money

0,I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me_comma_ she's such a quick learner.
0,What video games are the two of you playing?
0,Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them_comma_ It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence. 
0,It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.
1,It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.
1,You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.
1,I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!
1,I would assume so_comma_ since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!
1,Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!
0,I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.
0,Congrats! is it a good promotion?
0,It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office_comma_ and not just the one section I was in!

1,I put in to get a promotion at work_comma_ and I should know something either way by tomorrow.
0,Wow_comma_ that's really exciting! Good for you_comma_ you must be nervous. 
0,On the one hand_comma_ I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.
0,That's great_comma_ what kind of work are you in?
1,I work for a medical supply company.
0,Well I really hope you get it. You're right_comma_ you did what you could. 
1,Last week_comma_ they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.
1,That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.
1,I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man_comma_ but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!
1,I know in some places_comma_ the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes. 
1,Where I live_comma_ they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so_comma_ they lag far behind a lot of other states.
0,When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup
0,Was that a good day for you?
0,So good_comma_ genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!
0,That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?
0,But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.
0,Oh_comma_ but I bet you appreciated it! Summer can get long. 
0,It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives_comma_ cooked lots of stuff_comma_ goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand_comma_ I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.
0,Oh_comma_ that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count. 
0,Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!
0,It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. 
1,I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years_comma_ after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!

1,Yes indeed_comma_ there was even a frog under there! So bizarre! 
0,Oh goodness_comma_ glad you got through is safe lol
1,They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!
1,Oh_comma_ that's not right. I have a rescue dog_comma_ she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. 
1,Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.
1,I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. 
1,Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully_comma_ those animals can find good care and good homes.
1,That's great! So sad for those poor animals. 
1,And in my opinion_comma_ the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!
1,They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too. 
0,My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.

1,Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring_comma_ that is something to atleast be proud of!
1,And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad_comma_ but I take comfort in those things.
0,My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!
0,Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination_comma_ reading - all sorts of things!  
0,Yea_comma_ i was pretty proud of her_comma_ especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid. 
0,Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start_comma_ Select_comma_ A and B!
1,I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.

0,That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!
0,Yea i'm much better now_comma_ thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.
0,I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard_comma_ plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!
1,When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy

1,That is true_comma_ I should be thankful for that. 
1,I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs. 
1,I live in bear country.
1,They really startled me_comma_ the female did not seem happy to see me.

1,LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
1,I could_comma_ I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate. 
1,I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.
1,That sounds terrifying_comma_ so glad you did not step on it
1,Me too_comma_ that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now. 
1,I can imagine I would have nightmares about that

1,I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.

1,I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.
1,It's only normal to want to live within one's means. Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.
1,I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.
1,Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!
1,Yes_comma_ it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it_comma_ but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.
1,I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town_comma_ which is at some unspecified time today.

0,When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.
1,I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.
1,I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.

0,That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.
0,Yes_comma_ it is. I know that time heals.
0,My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So_comma_ I would have to let go and let them fly.

1,When I was in labor with my third child_comma_ they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room_comma_ my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.
1,Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing_comma_ especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?
1,Yes_comma_ everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.
1,I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!

1,Oh mine. That is not cute.
1,When I enter the bus_comma_ I fainted. I think that I got overheated.
1,That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?

1,Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.
1,I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends
1,It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.
1,I fell down_comma_ and apparently said some embarrassing things. 
1,You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.

0,I remember that feeling with my daughter_comma_ it is indescribable.

0,That's awesome!  That's great exercise! 
1,It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.
1,Oh_comma_ no! That's so terrible!
1,It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.

0,I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.

1,He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy_comma_ but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.
1,Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. 
1,I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.
1,Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!
1,Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.
1,As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you_comma_ I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it.

1,I saw one_comma_ and he said if I gave him $25_comma_000 he would clear me for flight_comma_ but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.
1,Now that is interesting_comma_ I wish you the best of luck.
1,I am obsessive about being ready for anything
1,Oh really? Are you afraid of missing out on something?
0,I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!
0,Well it is good to have extra food on hand these days. You never know what major event can happen.
1,My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.
0,Oh my! Is she ok_comma_ and was it while surfing?
0,She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her_comma_ then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.
0,Did you recover the leg? And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle_comma_ it wasn't a pleasant experience so I couldn't imagine hers. You are great for staying there.
1,It was swallowed whole_comma_ unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it_comma_ and neither will I.
1,I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.
1,How could you? Oh dear now you would have to apologise
1,I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.
1,I am glad that you were able to reschedule
1,I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet
1,I am sure that was an interesting conversation.  What did your friend think?
1,They think someone needs to take his phone away
1,Lol   I think that even the people who like him would agree with that
0,I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories! 
0,That must have really been a wonderful surprise!
0,It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times
0,Yeah childhood ends way too fast it's great when we have a chance to reflect on them.
1,The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane. 
1,Nice_comma_ the windy city! Had you been before?
1,I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too_comma_ though I wasn't feeling well.
1,Ive never been but would love to go one day! Ah no what was wrong?
1,I think my electrolytes were off_comma_ I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.
0,My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college
0,Aww_comma_ that is nice. Where did you study abroad?
0,I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe
0,Wow_comma_ how exciting! I also traveled Europe and Italy many years ago. I loved it!! Wish I could just move there. :)
0,I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.
0,Wow that's incredible. What was her anme?
1,Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.
0,Haha thats really funny. I bet she was a special person.
0,I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.
0,I am too! What are your plans?
0,Well In September_comma_ Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events_comma_ after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.
1,I've been to Universal and everything else around there_comma_ but sadly never during halloween_comma_ I've always wanted to.
0,I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.
0,That's rare these days_comma_ I was with mine for 7
0,Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.
1,I hope you at least got a severance package!
1,I told a lie to my mother.
1,Was it a bad one? And did she find out?
1,I was about school. And I eventually confessed.
1,Sometimes the lies get so heavy you just crack. Good for you though.
0,I got a job after a long period of unemployment.
0,I know how hard that can be. Is it working out?
0,Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.
0,It does take a lot of stress off of you.
1,I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.
1,I hope you are ok_comma_ what happened?
1,They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.
1,I can believe so _comma_ Hope you get justice_comma_ and a paycheck!
0,So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.
0,That's always fun! Did you get anything cool?
0,They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!
0,YAY! I think shoes are a great gift.
0,I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.
0,Nice_comma_ how did it go? Was the guy nice?
0,Yes_comma_ really smart and easy to talk to.
0,That's great! Did you get the job?
1,Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!
1,That sucks. Do you know what caused the outage?
1,Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.
1,You don't realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out.
1,I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car
0,Oh nice! That seems more likely than winning the state lottery. That would be so cool if you won!
1,Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research
0,That sounds like a really nice program. Where can I buy some tickets?!
0,Were they a close friend? And did you pay them with pizza?
0,Yes_comma_ and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.
0,I had a shoulder injury when i last moved_comma_ except I had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day.
1,I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win
1,Sorry to hear that. What would you do if you won it?
1,I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(
1,It is good to dream. Dreams can come true. :)
1,Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!
1,I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.
0,Oh _comma_ was it good? I've considered it.
0,It is good_comma_ but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.
1,Only if you are choosing that_comma_ over real tangible moments with friends or outside people.
1,I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking
1,That would take a miracle _comma_ or have some major money backing it.
1,Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump
1,Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values_comma_ not just pandering to the ignorant.
1,Im sorry to hear that_comma_ how long did you have him?
1,For 4 years. I'm bummed.
1,Yeah that is a long time for a fish_comma_ do you have plans to get another one
1,I had an unprofessional job interview.
1,The receptionist ignored me_comma_ and my interviewer was not prepared.
1,I hate when that happens_comma_ They expect us to be on point every time_comma_ yet they can't bother. I usually decline anything after.
1,My computer crashed while I was working on a project.
1,oh no! Did you lose a lot of work?
1,I did. I hadn't saved_comma_ and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.
1,I can relate. I have lost whole essays for the same reason. I had to call in sick for school because of it.
1,My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.
1,im a browns fan i feel that pain
1,I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.
1,yea me too it sucks
1,I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping
1,You should probably go to the doctor about that
1,yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what
0,You could have a tear on your eye. You really should get it checked out 
0,Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly
0,Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.
0,I bet that was fun_comma_ who did you go see?
0,I didn't catch his name_comma_ but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick_comma_ but I'll never forget it!
0,Magic is such a cool thing. That suspension of belief.
0,I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.
0,oh that's wonderful! Is it a job that you would enjoy?
0,Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.
0,that's great! I hope you do well and get the job. good luck!

0,Yes_comma_ she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.
0,That's wonderful. It's nice to have someone in life who cares for your well being.
0,So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.
1,Oh wow. How far away did you move??
1,Out of state. I'm by myself now_comma_ so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.
0,Awww! I know they miss you_comma_ too. I hope you're finding some fun with living on your own too!
0,My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.
0,I feel you. Last week_comma_ I spend 1000 dollars to fix my daughter's teeth. Dentists ask a lot of money now a days.
0,Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.
0,Ohh well that's good for you. These kind people always help in difficult times.
0,I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day. 
0,It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.
0,My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.
0,Ohh He is so hardworking. You are very lucky.
1,Yeah_comma_ he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines_comma_ I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now_comma_ he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.
0,Ohh good for you. You two are made for each other!
0,We really are_comma_ he brings out the best in me.
1,I didn't have a car to get to and from work_comma_ so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!
0,Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!
1,While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.
1,I bet that gave you some good feeelings
1,Oh for sure. Good feelings_comma_ but I also miss her so much.
1,Yeah I bet. but atleast you have the memorys
1,I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!

0,My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!
0,now thats some super news
0,It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.
0,So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.
0,He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it_comma_ I am so elated!
0,That is awesome! I bet your happy about that
0,I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!
1,Oh my gosh! How many did you adopt?!
0,Well it was only supposed to be her_comma_ but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.
0,Oh_comma_ I see! What a lovely surprise though. What did you do with her litter?
1,I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.
1,Yeah it is hard to leave our animals behind
1,It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.
0,That is nice of her!
0,So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.
0,Aww that's so cute! Did he enjoy it?
1,It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.
0,Poor guy was just nervous_comma_ I'm sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!
1,Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to
1,Well hopefully he is understanding_comma_ if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold 6 pack won't fix.
1,Ha ha_comma_ he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.
1,All is well that ends well_comma_ especially with family they gotta give ya do overs.
1,I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.
0,That is a great idea! how is it so far?
0,I start next week! I was super hesitant at first_comma_ but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.
0,Yeah you will improve yourself and feel good about it
0,I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.
0,Yeah_comma_ it really made me think of them and old times.
0,I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!
0,That's good_comma_ did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?
0,I was able to go home_comma_ but I realize now that I didn't even have to
0,Haha that;s rare when it comes to mechanics.
1,My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.
1,im sorry_comma_ thats awful. its a shame his parents arent being more supportive
1,They aren't being supportive at all_comma_ but that's not surprising_comma_ that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him_comma_ but I can't
1,im sure he appreciates having you around though
0,I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow
0,That was really nice of them. I bet you're appreciative.
0,Yes I am_comma_ they are great
0,I'm sure you'll do a favor for them in the future.
1,We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.
1,Yikes! That is terrible! What a awful thing to do! I am glad he finally got busted! Wow_comma_ for years_comma_ huh?
1,Yes_comma_ it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people
1,Yeah_comma_ me either. Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this.
0,I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best
0,That's great. College was also fun
0,College was pretty laid back for me_comma_ I did a lot of online classes.
1,I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her
1,I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.
1,Thank you_comma_ that means a lot. I will see her again
1,You will_comma_ and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!
1,I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!
1,Happens to everybody. My girlfriend_comma_ who is the smartest person I know_comma_ has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important_comma_ that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case_comma_ too!
1,That's pretty funny_comma_ and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!
1,I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home_comma_ or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.
1,I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.
0,Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.
0,Yeah I sure was_comma_ he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.
1,Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.
1,One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.
1,oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.
0,Yeah I figured it was_comma_ so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.
0,mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.
1,Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to_comma_ with one notable exception.
1,Hm_comma_ who might that be? 
0,My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!
0,Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!
0,I finished first in a race. I feel like gold
0,Oh my goodness!  That's amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?
0,Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off
0,That is awesome! It is for running?
0,Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises_comma_ but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.
0,That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?
1,They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport. 
0,That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important_comma_ are you a pilot now?
1,I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid
0,That's cool_comma_ did it bring back some good memories? 
1,Yeah_comma_ it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days
0,I love the 90's also_comma_ best decade in my opinion!
1,When I was in middle school_comma_ I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.
1,Oh no_comma_ did you get hurt?
1,Yes_comma_ the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents_comma_ it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.   
1,Yikes_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!
1,My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him_comma_ but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.
1,So what did you do?
1,We went_comma_ but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.
0,Well_comma_ I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.
1,My husband is on the road a lot_comma_ I hardley ever see him.
1,I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well. 
0,Yes_comma_ its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.
0,I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when I'm gone.
1,I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for
0,Just be confident and you will do great!
1,I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard
1,I'm moving in a few months to a new state_comma_ I'm starting to feel nervous.
0,Ah_comma_ yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?
0,To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.
0,That's a positive at least_comma_ good luck on the move!
1,I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.
1,Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!
1,It was pretty tramatic_comma_ I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No_comma_ I was on my way to work_comma_ I couldn't stop :(
1,That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. 
1,I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.
0,I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!
0,Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood_comma_ and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though_comma_ and now I have several!

0,I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!
0,Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?
0,He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)
0,That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things. 
0,It's been a great week! 
0,Good! What's been going on?
0,I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting! 
0,Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?
0,Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?
0,Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  
1,Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.
0,Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(
0,I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories. 
1,Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler_comma_ everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did_comma_ I'd consider using it again_comma_ or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm_comma_ you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else_comma_ there should be no shame.
0,Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.
0,Well_comma_ if I were you_comma_ I'd keep it up_comma_ whether or not my spouse laughed at me_comma_ or a new girlfriend/boyfriend_comma_ whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.
1,My dog got hit by a car.
1,Aw! That's horrible_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
1,He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.
1,That's so sad_comma_ I don't even know what to say!
1,Some random guy was in my backyard_comma_ I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.
1,Oh no! That is really creepy_comma_ why is he in your backyard?
1,Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first. 
1,Yeah_comma_ that's illegal I think_comma_ they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!
1,My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.
1,I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.
1,My siblings and I are managing_comma_ and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.
1,No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.
0,I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.
0,What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.
0,I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time
0,Must be nice_comma_ got any nice snacks?
1,I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.
1,Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. 
1,That is what I was thinking at the time_comma_ but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.
1,I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. 
1,I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.
1,Ah_comma_ I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?
1,It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.
1,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt! 
1,My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him
0,You're sweet_comma_ what kind of soup did you make him?
1,I made chicken noodle soup. 
0,I love chicken noodle_comma_ he must be so grateful.
1,I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.
1,I bet that was a little embarrassing.
1,After I figured out what I did_comma_ I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.
1,I am sure it was not as bad as you think. 
0,I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend. 
0,Wow! What kind of meeting is it?
0,It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.
0,Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!
1,I caught my boyfriend texting his ex
1,Oh no_comma_ was it romantic texts?
1,It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her
0,That's sad. I hope you are OK.
1,I know I broke up with my ex_comma_ but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.
1,That must be weird to talk to your ex still.
0,We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial_comma_ i think he does too. 
0,You must have feelings for him that are lingering.
0,I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.
0,Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?
0,On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well
0,As you should. You must have good teachers too!
1,I was very upset when I found my kitten today.
1,why? what happened to it? is it okay?
1,No_comma_ I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.
1,that sounds terrible_comma_ i hope you didn't cry alot.
1,I cried a bit_comma_ but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.
0,I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.

0,Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.
0,My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!
0,aww. im sure you must feel proud of him
0,Yes_comma_ very. But_comma_ time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!

1,Yes_comma_ and she had two children of her own_comma_ similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle_comma_ that made her mad! Can you believe that??
1,I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.
1,Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.
0,Aww_comma_ they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?
1,It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing. 
0,haha_comma_ I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.
1,I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!
0,I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding_comma_ I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well_comma_ it was still fun.
1,That is all that matters_comma_ its about the love.
1,One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me_comma_ while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!
1,I understand. Did you told your friend?
1,I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson_comma_ she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women_comma_ and stayed.....
1,The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.
1,Did you go see who it was?
1,No_comma_ I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.

0,That is great. What is it fun?
0,It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more
1,A few weeks ago_comma_ my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things_comma_ and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.
1,I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.
1,Yes_comma_ that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later. 
1,Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.
1,One night when my kids and I came home_comma_ I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.
1,In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.
1,Yes_comma_ and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But_comma_ luckily_comma_ it turned out to be my shadow!
1,I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?
1,There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do_comma_ as I feel it's my part to help those in need_comma_ as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.
1,I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.
1,Well_comma_ homeless people aren't common in my area_comma_ so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. 
1,It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!
0,When my children were born_comma_ it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.
0,Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. 
0,Yes_comma_ I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl_comma_ both healthy_comma_ smart and wonderful.
0,Thats perfect_comma_ a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. 
1,I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in_comma_ so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.
0,In what do you believe?
1,Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another_comma_ just because of their religion or skin color_comma_ or where they come from.
0,That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?
1,They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven_comma_ while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that_comma_ but chose to keep my mouth shut!
1,I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it_comma_ especially on the highway.
1,What car did you buy?
1,Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.
1,Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.
0,I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.
0,Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.
0,It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them
0,You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?
1,A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!
1,That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?
1,I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!
0,I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.
0,Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!
0,I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.
0,That must have been nice. I keep cards too.
1,It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel_comma_ if someone's taken the time to write_comma_ I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?
1,Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards_comma_ photos_comma_ school projects. Everything. We arent here forever
0,That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!
1,I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
0,I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with_comma_ lol.
1,When I was entering the store it was really slippery.
1,It had been raining _comma_ so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.
1,Oh no_comma_ were you okay
1,I was fine_comma_ just felt like every one was looking at me.
1,I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.
1,Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?
1,I don't want to out her to her husband_comma_ usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.
1,Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!
1,Thanks_comma_ I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.
1,I feel kind of blue today_comma_ they announced the parts for the annual play.
1,Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?
1,I did_comma_ and it is a good one_comma_ just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.
1,I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.
0,It is_comma_ my friend got it_comma_ or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.
0,I'm teaching my daughter how to drive_comma_ and so far_comma_ so good!
0,That is wonderful_comma_ I imagine she is very excited.
1,She is!  At first_comma_ though_comma_ she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road_comma_ so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.
1,Okay i see well_comma_ take your time she will be getting her liscense soon
0,Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.
0,She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.
0,I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!
0,It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.
1,My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.
1,That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?
1,I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse_comma_ I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom_comma_ shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*
1,I'm sure you will get it done!
0,My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.
0,Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?
0,We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.
0,I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that
0,We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.
1,Don't be! There are many_comma_ many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)
0,I will work on it with my family. 
0,My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after_comma_ going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.
0,Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!
0,I am quite proud_comma_ thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist_comma_ (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!
0,Man_comma_ that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!
0,Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.
1,Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?
0,I got the assignment yesterday_comma_ and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week_comma_ and then after that I'll be on my own.
0,Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!
1,I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.
1,Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?
1,Only for funerals_comma_ unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life_comma_ I'm afraid.
1,Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?
1,Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here_comma_ but she was 96_comma_ so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!
1,96! Wow. Thats a full life!
1,She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!
1,Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.
0,I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before

0,I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.
0,Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!

0,I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.
0,I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger_comma_ but I am blessed she's still here.
0,I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.
0,I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!
0,are they typically bad or something?
0,The live upstairs and constantly thump around_comma_ screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...
0,Oh that makes sense_comma_ well enjoy the peace and quiet!
0,Oh I am_comma_ believe me I am. The world seems like a calm_comma_ serene place where everything is just right!
0,My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it
0,Thats awesome. What did you guys do?
0,We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor
1,I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten_comma_ with no collar_comma_ in a window well.
1,Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?
0,We actually did_comma_ and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula_comma_ but now he is thriving!

0,Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it
1,Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving

0,Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.
1,I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!
1,I'm sure she understands_comma_ just tell the truth!
1,I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( 
1,Yeah_comma_ I'd be pretty scared too_comma_ but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest
1,You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???
1,I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party_comma_ not my greatest moment
1,Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?
1,I thought that it was a pajama party haha_comma_ never worn a dress before_comma_ maybe that's the secret
1,Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.
1,I had some trippy nightmares as a kid_comma_ now I don't really have dreams
1,Oh man_comma_ I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?
1,Yeah_comma_ it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me_comma_ pretty weird
1,Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.
1,I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards
1,So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?

0,I'm glad to see you ! 
0,I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 
0,"That is very encouraging news .

1,No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
0,"I will . Thank you , Mummy . "
0,"Don ' t worry about it , just ask . "
0,All right . That sounds like fun .

1,"But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up ! "

0,"So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ? "
1,"Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry . "
1,"Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me . "

1,Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
1,Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
1,"Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! "
1,"Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? "
1,I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
0,I had a fantastic time .

0,Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
0,"Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... "

0,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
0,"Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . "
0,"It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . "
0,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
0,I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
1,But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
1,"Yes , but you might have told me before . "
1,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
1,"Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
0,Thanks a lot for your help . 
0,"No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? "
0,All right . See you tomorrow night . 
1,I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . 
1,I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
1,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! 
0,"I will , thanks for your concern . "
0,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 
0,I'm crazy about it . It makes me very excited . 
0,Then tell me what's good about it . 
0,It can't be expressed by words . 
0,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . "
0,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . "
0,"Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . "
0,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . "
0,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? "
0,"Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . "
0,"That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . "
0,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . 
0,"Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . "
0,"Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . "
0,It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . 
1,Not great . It's a kind of boring . 
0,Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . 
1,"Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . "
0,"Hi , Tina , I ' Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . "
0,That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . 
0,"I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . "
1,Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? 
0,Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! 
0,"Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! "
0,"OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... "
0,"Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot . There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
1,It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? 
1,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
1,I hate to go outside . 
1,I meet too many jerks . 
1,This city is full of jerks . 
1,You can yell at them . 
1,And they will yell back at you . 
0,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
1,Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . 
1,"If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . "
0,Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
0,With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . 
0,"Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . "
0,But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . 
0,"Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? "
0,Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 
0,Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then . 
0,"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . "
0,"Yes , my friends like to get along with me well . "
0,Do you have many friends ? 
0,"Yes , I like to make new friends . "
0,What do you usually do with them ? 
0,"We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music . "
0,"Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . "
0,How about the new bar across the road ? 
0,Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
0,"I agree , I had lunch there last week . "
0,Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
1,Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
1,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
1,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
1,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
1,To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
0,"That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . "
0,Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . 
1,"I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? "
0,"Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . "
0,"Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . "
0,"Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? "
0,"Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . "
1,Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
0,Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
0,Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning . 
0,I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
0,I ' m sure I will . 
0,"Have a nice journey , Lily . "
0,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
0,"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . "
0,"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . "
0,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . "
0,"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . "
0,"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? "
0,"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . "
0,"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . "
0,And the host announced that he won it all ! 
0,Thank you . I will go get one . 
0,"Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . "
0,"Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . "
0,Thanks you for the encouragement . 
0,You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye . 
0,Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! 
1,I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow . 
0,"Nice to see you , Patrick . "
0,Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
0,Yeah . All of us tried our best . 
0,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
0,"Oh , it's nothing to speak of . "
0,"No , seriously . I am impressed . "
0,Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
1,I just watched a movie and I'm scared . 
0,This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . 
0,En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . 
1,But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... 
1,"This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . "
1,"The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . "
1,I can ' t bear it . The driver is too bad . 
1,Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . 
0,What are you going to do next year ? 
0,I want to go traveling . 
0,Do you have any where in mind ? 
0,"Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . "
0,Almost two years ? Your English is very good . 
0,Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . 
0,"It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . "
0,"Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . "
1,Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
1,what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
0,We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? 
0,"Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! "
0,"All right , just a quick one . "
1,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . "
1,I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . 
1,"Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? "
0,"Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight . "
0,"Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . "
0,You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? 
0,We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . 
0,So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
0,"Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . "
0,"Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . "
0,"Five o ' clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? "
0,"Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation . "
0,I am going to invite other guys . See you that day . 
0,That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
0,"I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . "
0,"Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . "
0,"Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? "
0,"No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . "
0,Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . 
0,Thank you very much for your kindness . 
0,"Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . "
0,That ' s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . 
0,"I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . "
0,And English is very useful in your job . 
0,"I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . "
0,You will be a very promising one . 
1,I didn't know you had a brother . 
0,"Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? "
0,"Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . "
0,"I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . "
0,Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . 
1,"My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? "
0,"Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . "
0,"Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? "
0,"They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . "
0,When are they going to have the party ? 
0,Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . 
0,"Wow , that would be something to look forward to . "
0,wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! 
0,"great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . "
0,no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 
0,"Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . "
0,Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ' s been such a long time ! 
0,"Darlene ! Indeed , it ' s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ' Ve done with your hair ! "
0,"Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ' t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! "
0,"Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ' Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! "
0,"Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . "
0,He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
0,"Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . "
0,Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
0,Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
0,"But of course ! Well , it ' s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . "
0,"Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! "
0,That would be great ! Give me a call ! 
0,See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
0,"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? "
0,Yes . Do you like it ? 
0,It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . 
0,Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . 
0,Is classical music your favorite ? 
0,"oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . "
0,I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
0,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
0,"Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? "
0,"Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . "
0,Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
0,"Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . "
0,"Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend . "
1,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! 
1,I don't know if anything terrible has happened . 
0,Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
0,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . "
0,Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
0,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? "
0,You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . 
0,"Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! "
0,"Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! "
0,How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? 
0,Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
0,Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! 
0,"The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . "
0,What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! 
0,"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . "
0,You are invited to my wedding . 
0,Thank you . I'll certainly be there . 
0,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . "
0,"what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . "
0,"oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? "
0,Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! 
0,Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . 
0,Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . 
0,That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? 
0,Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . 
0,It really must be an exciting time for you guys . 
1,Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? 
0,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 
0,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? "
1,What a pity ! You can't join us . 
0,"So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . "
0,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? "
0,Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . 
1,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . 
1,I did . But they said they won ' t change them . 
0,I ' ll be glad to help . 
0,All you have to do is ask for help . 
0,I ' m ready and willing to help . 
0,Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? 
0,Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . 
0,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? "
1,"It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . "
0,"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? "
1,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation . 
1,"I don ' t think you do.If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . "
1,Fine . I ' ll take the compact . 
1,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . "
0,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
1,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
1,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
1,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
1,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
1,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! "
0,"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . "
0,"I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . "
0,"Helen , did you hear I ' m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . "
0,"No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . "
0,Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . 
1,It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . 
0,"Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . "
1,I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
1,Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
1,"Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! "
1,Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
1,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! "
1,I think someone is stalking me . 
1,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? "
1,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . "
1,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . "
1,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
0,"OK , I'd love the company . "
0,This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . 
0,"even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . "
0,I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
0,Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
0,It's got to be almost a year now . 
0,I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
0,"Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? "
0,"Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . "
0,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 
0,I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
1,"You went out and bought khakis , too ! "
0,Alright . What do you want to do now ? 
0,Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . 
0,Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? 
0,Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . 
0,They must be amazing animals . 
0,They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . 
0,I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . 
0,They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . 
0,I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
1,"Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . "
0,Tim ' s smiles are interesting . 
0,"Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . "
0,You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
0,How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! 
0,Have you enjoyed your weekend ? 
0,"Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . "
0,Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . 
0,Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 
0,"Great ! Wait here ? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? "
0,The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait ! 
0,Let ' s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 
0,You have such good ideas ! 
0,All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! 
0,Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
0,Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . 
0,Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . 
0,"It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . "
0,"It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! "
1,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
1,"Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
1,I didn't really like it . 
1,I found it very disappointing . 
1,I wasn't happy with it . 
0,"Good afternoon ! Sit down , please . How are you ? "
0,"I'm very well , thank you . How are you ? "
0,"Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ? "
0,"Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . "
0,How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . 
0,No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? 
0,"Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . "
0,"Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? "
0,I know . It was a really good deal . 
1,Maybe ... but I don't think so . 
1,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . 
0,"Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . "
0,"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . "
1,Really ? I will slow down then . 
0,"It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . "
0,That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 
0,Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
1,"My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . "
0,"I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . "
0,Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . 
0,"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you . "
0,It's a good day for a picnic . 
1,Turn on the TV for what ? 
1,"Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "
1,"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . "
0,Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! 
0,Brian ! How have you been ? 
0,"Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! "
0,"Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . "
0,"Well , you look great ! How are you ? "
0,I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . 
0,"It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . "
0,Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it . 
0,"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . "
0,"Yeah , I will . See you then ! "
1,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
1,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
1,"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! "
0,How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! 
0,"Of course , otherwise you ' ll just have to wait for hours . "
0,"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . "
0,You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
