1,It was 30s for me!  She kept at her classes_comma_ even though she had two kids pretty young and worked.
1,No because my brain was not working properly. I didn't know what was the surgery about. I awoke finding people washing my private part. I felt bad.
1,No_comma_ luckily I swerved into the outer-most lane and there wasn't a car there. Thank God!
1,Wow that is a long move!
1,I was devastated. We thought we were going to get a TV_comma_ or a Playstation or something. Nope_comma_ just a pair of some old boring shoes that only 60 year old men wore. Livid.
1,Im not sure what I want to do career wise.
1,My girlfriend got me a Playstation 4 for my birthday. I was not expecting it at all.

1,come to find out it was my neighbors dog eating all of the plants and vegetables!

1,Oh_comma_ that's awesome. You feeling nervous about that? 
1,So you ever break something and blame the dog?
1,Just moved here for work_comma_ and I don't know anyone. My coworkers have families of their own.
1,I appreciate that. And I try to tell myself that imperfections help people stay grounded and kind. But it's still hard not to get so self-conscious about it in everyday life. I almost want to grab something and grind them down!
1,I've done that before.. it gets super dark on the highways and you don't realize it till you don't have any lights shining.
1,ah that sucks!! bad luck!!
1,Do you have a past traumatic experience?
1,The rain will go away tomorrow.

1,I'm so sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope you find it.
1,Yesterday I went to the doctor  and had to get a shot.

1,I know the feeling. I wish I knew where to go meet people in my new city.
1,Good Job to her! I bet you were so proud of her!
1,If they don't_comma_ that's their loss. My family are so important to me - I love them dearly. The same goes for my close friends. Don't listen to other people - they're the ones missing out!
1,That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system.
1,I bet. What school is she going to?
1,That's really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship.
1,Oh no! Is what you have in there worth more than 500?
1,Oh good.  Well_comma_ at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work.

1,I wish I did not cheat on my gf.
1,What did you do with it?
1,Yeah sounds like he needs a taste of his own medicine lol
1,You're so welcome! Good luck and I hope it's a great place with a good paycheck!
1,shes about to be strapped so i wont have to worry as much!
1,I need someone to date so badly. I cannot hold it anymore

1,What did they do to make you proud?
1,I used to hang out  with my best friend everyday and now I have no one to hang out with.

1,It was a strawberry pie. And yeah_comma_ I think he may have a natural talent for this! I told him that he should start taking it seriously and training for it.
1,Did you go with her anyway?
1,Oh_comma_ I see.   I guess its kinda hard to give a friend you have a long time over a lie they told.   Hopefully he/she had a good reason to tell the lie then.
1,That's exactly what my sister said. She should have understood the reason why I could not lend her the watch.
1,always believe in yourself_comma_ and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings 
1,Oh_comma_ that's cool! How many do you have?
1,I've been taking care of my youngest daughter today. She has a cold.

1,Yeah_comma_ got to think of something or I am doomed.
1,They gave me a surprise birthday party for me
1,Well_comma_ he's small and he got bit by a chipmunk. Got some kind of incurable disease that makes me run around in circles constantly without breaking for food. He's going to waste away to nothing at this rate.
1,My husband got a nice raise at work!
1,Yes_comma_ death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life.

1,There is no better feeling than being greeted at the door by your dog
1,I take the bus so I don't have to deal with the traffic_comma_ but man that sounds like it would really stink
1,Why Disney Land is like one quarter the size?

1,I'm just enjoying a peaceful Sunday.

1,Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be
1,hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
1,Omg_comma_ that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up.
1,Hopefully he continues his streak at LA as well
1,I csn judy feel it
1,Yes_comma_ I think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood.
1,Well_comma_ that does sure sound like a show. I bet they shared a bunch of laughs over those wretched and foul farts.
1,a few days I think
1,Right_comma_ change is often difficuly
1,I get sentimental about my family_comma_ they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them

1,I did! I got so many cool gifts.
1,Oh really?  What's the good news?
1,I LOVE watermelon...Geez- I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too

1,That is good for him. You can still visit him.
1,I am so pumped up. I would love to do that. Great idea.
1,Well_comma_ wasn't really the dog's fault. It was my friends' fault that they didn't show up.

1,Are you in college or high school?
1,exactly! the world would be such a better place

1,Oh wow. so she's kind of famous it seems

1,Ah_comma_ I see. Well_comma_ it's a good thing you were rejected thing_comma_ maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus_comma_ this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out_comma_ it will be easier.

1,When I had to take care of my sick brother who had the flu_comma_ during this time I had to watch over him and make sure he was taking his medicine and take his temperature constantly

1,I have been without water for two days and my water company still hasnt fixed the issue.
1,Yeah_comma_ they got me a cake from that bakery you recommended. Wonder who let them know it was my new favorite place for sweets.

1,YEs it does_comma_ take advantage of the time you have now

1,Cool. Was it an all nighter?
1,I stole money from the church collection plate.
1,Security at the grocery store followed me to my car the other day.
1,I don't know what I would do without my parents.

1,I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents
1,I recently found out I am getting a pay raise at work! 
1,I've never tried to make that - but it looks nice.
1,I can honestly say I have everything i could ever ask for.

1,I like your positive attitude!
1,That is gracious of you. I haven't done that in awhile.

1,That is great. Would you be an astronaut then?
1,It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath_comma_ focus on one small success_comma_ then move to the next.  
1,Mine too. I love the trees in fall
1,I ruined my friends wedding because of my drunken behavior
1,That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?

1,You're welcome. Goals is what makes life matters sometimes.

1,I went to the bowling alley yesterday all alone - my friends ditched me.
1,Maybe you should ask your boss? Maybe he is more charasmatic. That happens sometimes. I am sorry. I've been there!

1,just study harder_comma_ youll pass eventually i assure you that 
1,i wanna go to vegas to go gamble a little 
1,I understand. Taking some rest is important.

1,I am sure you will do great.
1,Oh wow_comma_ was it good

1,Hello! So you even win a eating contest before? I won a Jello eating one back in scouts.

1,Okay so I've never been a good cook but the first time I ever made a casserole was a diasaster. I went to pull it out of the oven and part of my oven mitt must have not been insolated well_comma_ so I dropped it and it shattered the door to my stove.

1,What concert?  Did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date?
1,I've definitely gained weight this summer from eating so much ice cream haha

1,that's not good :( i hope you don't drive under influence anymore_comma_ you could've gotten into an accident
1,What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?
1,Wow_comma_ you must be euphoric!

1,There si always a fight when my family gets together
1,Pay me for my service!
1,I do like them but I haven't been on that many_comma_ unfortunately.
1,I'm sure they'll be delicious.
1,I loaned my car to a girlfriend once many years ago.
1,My friends wouldn't go with me to the gym last night. I was so mad that I shattered my phone.

1,I sure hope so_comma_ do you think he is a determined and intelligent person?
1,Kind of scared to file for my financial aid this year. Not sure if it will cover all my expenses for the semester. If it doesn't_comma_ I don't know how I'll make ends meet and attend school.
1,Yeah_comma_ I know. But since we've lived near each other for a long time and have had similar lives_comma_ I can't help comparing myself to him. 
1,Why do you fail? Do you not study?
1,Nope. :( It's such a pain too. Having to contact the credit card company and get a new card issued.

1,My best friend is  keeping all of my life's savings at her house
1,Last year_comma_ my family went on vacation and left me all alone.
1,I had a very fierce argument with my partner last night. She left the house in the middle of the night and I am not sure if she will ever come back
1,Well I bought a bunch of scratch offs today.  I really wanna win the lottery.
1,I don't have any kids_comma_ but I can only imagine.  It even seems like I'm growing old fast.
1,It is! It's sort of like how if someone packs you a little note with your lunch_comma_ it's really nice_comma_ but obviously if you made your own note you'd just feel silly.
1,A couch! how was it hurting you?
1,Yes_comma_ I worked hard on them all summer_comma_ so I was pretty angry.
1,We've moved a lot of the past decade for my husband's job.
1,It's always good to go to places that make you feel younger again_comma_ it brings back good memories.
1,I ordered about $50 worth of groceries_comma_ just the basics.  But no_comma_ they ended up coming late. And_comma_ they forgot some items.

1,He told people i was mean to him.
1,Someone that I went to high school with is really sick and it sounds like they might die soon.  Its upsetting to hear news like that.  It makes you think about things.

1,My buddy at work just went and bought a really nice boat.
1,Yeah_comma_ you can really get in major trouble for doing that.
1,My daughter is so silly. Sometimes its okay. Sometimes its annoying.

1,I knew I was going to pass my math test. I studied all week
1,For sure. Are you female or male
1,Yes_comma_ it was really good.
1,Well_comma_ that wasn't a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard_comma_ rather than losing the old friend.
1,you have a great dad
1,i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my car door
1,I do too. Everyone deserves to have someone in their corner.
1,I took the last piece of chicken at dinner_comma_ I shouldn't of.
1,Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate.
1,I am not even sure if he has any concrete plans to tackle this issue. If not_comma_ then Congress must act to stop it from happening
1,Have you talked to her about this ?
1,Next week might be fun.....kinda scared though :/
1,Definitely. It was just some random guy_comma_ and he was really incompatible with me too so it was really frustrating that they didn't room us together.
1,I think we'll be fine.   Peopel talk a lot about a trade war but_comma_ leave out the fact that places like the EU already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.      How can they call us raising our tariffs a trade war if they're still lower than what they bill us? 
1,Not at all. They were understanding and we had a good laugh about it. I did feel a little guilty about it though
1,That is not too bad. What kind of cake was it?
1,So exciting! Where are you going again?
1,What were the pictures of?
1,Were there a lot of people around?
1,I sleep with the windows open_comma_ but it's the first wasp I've seen all summer
1,yikes_comma_ that sucks. Hopefully you found one that worked eventually.
1,Very cool. My own father passed away a few years ago. I miss doing things with him. 
1,That is great! I bet you are feeling very good.
1,I kept hearing odd sounds all night... it turned out to be a racoon in the attic
1,I don't want him to go but he is really ill
1,I can imagine! Watching games can get wild sometimes!
1,I had a great job interview the other day. Im really feeling good about how it went.
1,I went to the skating rink all by myself yesterday. 
1,i know. i was just curious if we would be linked up again.
1,I am starting a new job and am so nervous but equally excited.
1,I'm leaving for college soon. I have never been so far from home alone.
1,I can see where that would be embarrassing.  I hope your pride wasn't hurt too much... or you physically!
1,I invited my boyfriend's parents to a cookout out my family's house recently_comma_ and completely blanked on their names when it was time to introduce them
1,Sunglasses. They were back ordered and didn't arrive in time for my trip to the beach.
1,My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show.
1,I undertstand that_comma_ I would be very upset as well
1,In a few weeks my best friend and I are going to go see Ben Folds_comma_ I can't wait.
1,omg !! you would have been devastated!!

1,When I was a kid_comma_ I watched Psycho at a sleepover on Halloween.
1,That sucks! I'm sure it hurt your feelings.
1,Yes_comma_ I just checked my account and realized I am broke :(
1,Whoa!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you want to kill the guy?
1,I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job?
1,I was making fries and started a grease fire but luckily I always keep a box of baking soda on hand when I cook and I was able to quickly put it out.
1,That's perfect then_comma_ i'm sure you did a great job@
1,Yes_comma_ that always saddens me too. I see them now and then.
1,Unlike many of my friends I was confident when I went to job interviews and I always got the job. I guess I was lucky.
1,My out-of-town relatives are visiting_comma_ and there was on relative whom I really enjoy speaking with_comma_ that I didn't get to hang out with much while they were here. I won't get to seem them for a while_comma_ so it kind of stinks we didn't make the most of our time this weekend
1,That does make such a difference_comma_ a job that you enjoy
1,I hope you can. If you think there's even a chance_comma_ then give it a shot_comma_ if it will save you that much money. My brother watches Youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things_comma_ and it seems to work for him. If you're the type of person that can learn that way_comma_ and if you have the patience_comma_ then I think it's a good thing to try.
1,oh man I fell down a flight of stairs at the LSU game last weekend. I was mortified because everyone laughed.
1,HAHA_comma_ you wanted him gone? maybe he did it to spite you.
1,It was unexpected. I thanked them
1,It just kinda happens occasionally.
1,oh wow thats quite a while
1,It is definitely worth a visit. If you come from the east_comma_ skip kansas_comma_ Its flat which is cool for a while_comma_ but then just the smell of cow.
1,Yeah but_comma_ it won't be quite the same.
1,Oh that's not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out! 
1,Im leaving for vacation this weekend. It has been a long time since I have had time off. I can not wait to go.
1,No_comma_ it's just a little cut that needs to heal.
1,Game of thrones is about to end. I can't believe they are going to do this to me!
1,I hope everything turns out good for you two!
1,It is only $175_comma_ but I am hoping that is enough to make the instructor extra careful!
1,I was alone before meeting my girlfriend and friend group
1,Not really_comma_ but I got used to it ahaha.
1,My brother's dog pooped upstairs_comma_ and I didn't see it_comma_ and ended up stepping in it...
1,How many people are in your family?
1,I am so sad Anthony Bourdain died.
1,There's a lot of people who do not so well on tests_comma_ do you get another chance?
1,My friend works 2 jobs to support her 3 kids
1,I went to an old part of town and these guys really scared me.
1,I let Daisy my cat out the other evening and she didn't come back home.
1,I hope you win too!  Scratch them now and let me know if you win.  Now I'm excited for you! Hope you hit a big bank!

1,That was a crappy thing to do. Better get a handle on it now or it could become a big problem.

1,I was walking down the beach and this guy did a double backflip from just the ground. I was amazed
1,When i see a high end cars. I just envy them

1,Yes I did. But I knew I would.I am the top worker. 
1,I was suppose to help me move from my apartment. He didn't come and turned off his cell phone.
1,I am not sure why...but ever since my body changed so much in pregnancy..and I am having to work so hard to get it back to normal..somedays I am just uncomfortable and don't want to wear anything and I don't want to go out
1,Oh no! Was it damaged?
1,That is strange. Did you like the gift?

1,Why did you think he was after you?
1,Yeah_comma_ I know it's only a natural thing. But I still felt super uncomfotable.
1,She's not!  I can't believe it_comma_ I'm so happy with how grown up she is now.
1,It was a huge achievement when I graduated too. Did you get good grades?
1,I hope it turns out ok.

1,It was such a streeful way to start the day_comma_ with no prior notice to the management change_comma_ and there firing.
1,"I was eating breakfast when my daughter screamed_comma_ ""There a humongous spider behind you!"""
1,What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.
1,Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!
1,That's what I tried to tell her! I think she's being catfished. She ends up sending him money that she really needs herself.
1,I did and she really didn't have any good excuse. Just being inconsiderate.
1,I am glad for him. Bullies should not be allowed to behave badly towards others.
1,Alright alright_comma_ you can go the slow route

1,Thank you but it never seems like it's enough. I always want to do more!
1,He was! He's a really good guy honestly_comma_ and we've gotten closer since then
1,Maybe. She has a lot of mental difficulties that makes it hard to be around her. Short visits are okay_comma_ but anything longer than that gets uncomfortable. 
1,did you check ebay ? its cheaper tehre
1,Yeah I hate that too
1,I agree.  No amount of money could replace it.  I will end up giving to my kids for sure.

1,Definitely. I've been traveling for over 45 minutes to the nearest one.
1,Im glad you are ok_comma_ How is your community.

1,whoa thats shocking! how old is she?
1,Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway?
1,OH no. I didn't have that problem in MExico
1,Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way_comma_ cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right

1,I am so happy for you.
1,I'm a little shaken up_comma_ but I think I'll be okay. Especially because no one was hurt during the robbery.

1,cause he had the stones to leave the cavs again.. which was the right move
1,Do you play on a professional team?
1,Maybe I do. I kept this one and named it Kitty the Kat.

1,This is an important time for our family because our son is applying for colleges this year. We're all nervous!
1,I will try but it's my brother he took a car I saved so much to buy and had an accident with it 
1,Well_comma_ at the very least_comma_ from the little that you've said_comma_ you seem very self-aware. That's a very underrated trait for people to have and to develop.. so whatever it is you decide_comma_ it seems like you'll be efficient at seeing it through. Good luck!
1, Are you going to ride roller coasters
1,It was six months ago. I will believe anything. 
1,I have never seen a movie before
1,Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.
1,I am an older student too so I hope things go well for me in school.
1,It sure is_comma_ I hope it continues!
1,Well you did what you were supposed to do. It's their fault for saying what they said.

1,I've tried some of the cheaper virtual reality headsets_comma_ but I'm sure they can't compare at all!
1,You never know. Some places try to lowball pretty hard.   IT is a unique job.  If everything works_comma_ people wonder why they pay you.  If nothing works_comma_ people also wonder why they pay you.
1,was happy to see my dog ricky return home
1,My partner. I hope when I am out that she knows she can trust me
1,That is disappointing.  Is there other things you can apply for?

1,My apartment complex is nickel and diming me and counting off so many things wrong with the apartment to detract from my security deposit as I get set to leave after this month.

1,I hope you'll get another opportunity or even a better one.
1,Now that is one of the most unfortunate things I've heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww
1,Good. A haircut always makes me feel more confident

1,That's becoming a common occurrence! They just couldn't keep up with trends.
1,I really thought that me and this girl were right for each other but things didn';t work out.

1,Why would they do that?
1,Your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude. You got this.

1,Watching someone stream an old video game on Twitch_comma_ one that I used to play. It's one that's like almost 20 years old_comma_ that I used to play when I was 11. Makes me wish I didn't have so many bills and responsibilities!
1,Yeah_comma_ i'm going to have to reschedule.
1,Relationship drama. Someone who has a lot of mental and emotional issues_comma_ thats why I live alone and don't see many so it can get hard on days like the weekend.

1,The person bragged about doing something_comma_ that they didn't actually do. Which was highly inappropriate for the job we had. I had to tell the manager due to liability issues. All for it to not even be true.
1,I love pecan pie. My grandma used to make it
1,No I dont I really want to one day_comma_ I think i would be good at it.
1,Yeah because faithfulness is what defines a true friendship_comma_ after all.
1,They were really lous and cursing all night and their toddlers were playing inthe street. Im kind of scared of them
1,Oh I'm sorry. Have you tried to talk to people?
1,I should. Im always a bridesmaid and I'm sick of it.
1,I hope my dog returns home!
1,I'm fine but I was wearing nice clothes and they got a bit ruined.
1,The place didn't fall apart did it?
1,Aww_comma_ I bet you miss her a lot. Well it's good you get to see her soon!
1,Whoa that's out of left field_comma_ how'd that happen.
1,Did you prepare for it?
1,Yea_comma_ I got lucky in that regard.
1,That's great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did_comma_ and it was about 400 miles.
1,Congrats. I hope you'll like what you're doing
1,I just started learning last month and I love it as well. 
1,That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me 
1,I purchased a new truck today.
1,My wife just confessed that she cheated_comma_ im irritated at her behaviour. Totally dissapointed
1,I don't think that being bossy. You are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently 
1,I went through some pretty tough times. Still_comma_ I believed things would get better eventually.
1,I am very happy lately.
1,Congratulations I know you must be very proud
1,i cant say that i do
1,He came back on his own!
1,Waiting for my pho delivery
1,"I know! He said ""alfredo""! How zany is that! "
1,Its nice to find good deals
1,Yeah its all repaired now. I also bought lots of food in case we loose power.
1,Oh_comma_ that sounds rough. Were you successful?
1,That's some bad luck. I hope it wasn't too much of a hassle.
1,I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.
1,I was a little sad when i didnt win the lottery yesterday
1,Indeed. It would be interesting to watch for time to come. Criminal investigation coming to conclusion and what to do about Strzok and his thug evildoing. 
1,my body is great i worked hard towards it
1,I love boots fall is best for fashion
1,Hopefully you don't wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often.
1,My mom_comma_ who's in her 60s_comma_ lost her best friend today_comma_ who passed away. She was one of the only friends my mother had_comma_ and I feel sad for her since she lost a connection to her childhood and past. She seems really lonely.
1,I do nit think I have heard of that game. Was it pretty popular?
1,That is scary! I've never flown before_comma_ the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving.
1,i ate my wife's leftovers while she was taking a nap
1,Probably because I am insecure.
1,I wish I had a bigger house_comma_ I see people with these nice houses and feel envious.'
1,Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost.
1,Yes indeed. I stepped in to help not really knowing what  I was doing. I screwed up at first a bunch but after all day working on it_comma_ I got it fixed!
1,I was pretty upset when my friend lost her husband. 
1,Yesterday I was so content. i sat outside and watched my kids play on their waterslide.
1,Yeah - what did she do?
1,Those are so tasty_comma_ are you excited?
1,My oldest daughter was in a running club at her school_comma_ and she won her very first race.
1,Can't believe my professor marked all this wrong.
1,I just drove to the town over with my animals_comma_ that town did not get a drop of rain.
1,I would love that! Give me that feeling :)
1,My episode films next week. Hopefully I can win.
1,I did! I spent the entire week hard at the books. I've never felt so ready for a test before.
1,oooh_comma_ thats so scary and bad of them
1,That's certainly true.  If nothing happens by next week_comma_ I won't really have a choice.  Maybe I can consult with them confidentialy
1,I bet your excited about it!
1,I got mad last year when I was fired
1,He just made me a grand father_comma_ he had twins :)
1,For sure.Organize scheduled helps a lot to have success
1,I wouldn't know. I defnitely didn't want to risk it and declined the offer!
1,Because I have no friends. It makes me so lonely and unwanted. 
1,I was doing this chat room thing_comma_ and I walked away for a minute. 
1,Haha_comma_ Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?
1,Do you at least get to ride in it with him?
1,I just finished an interview for a new job!  I am fairly certain I nailed it!
1,She has worked really hard at her routines. I was beaming with pride!
1,I am so hype for the new super smash bros_comma_ are you a fan of the series?
1,I never use it and I don't think I ever will
1,It is for a manager position. I just wish they would call soon. Its hard waiting around.
1,That was nice_comma_ you should help them next time.
1,Oh goodness_comma_ is she okay?
1,At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.
1,We took my neice and nephew to the lake this weekend!
1,That i will get the job
1,It ended up going well and I got the job_comma_ I didn't need to be so nervous
1,I broke my coffee maker today and i'm so mad because i can't make coffee. I can't survive the morning without coffee
1,What does she want to do?
1,Yes_comma_ but she was concerned about her baby. I was very optimistic for her.
1,It was REALLY good! I didn't expect it to be that deep. I don't wanna spoil it :)
1,yea i was quite envious of him
1,I definitely will! I can't wait because I love Christmas time.  I feel like a big kid during that season. 
1,I panicked and he caught up. He walked by quickly and said a really nasty word in the creepiest way. But he kept going.  My knees were shaking. 
1,Did something go wrong with the interview?
1,I know what you mean_comma_ hope it gets better!
1,I'm not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape! 
1,That's awful he might be in your house.
1,Ugh I was hoping that is not the case_comma_ I would want my kid to be young forever
1,For one of the first times_comma_ I was really excited to take a physics test because I knew I was gonna  ace it.
1,i hope the cops took care of it
1,He starts next week. My mom took him yesterday and got all his supplies and some new clothes.
1,Hi I am so mad at my friend.
1,That is so sweet. I want a puppy. and a boyfriend.
1,When I was a little girl_comma_ we had a house fire and it burned to the ground.
1,Me neither. I spoke to someone who had seen a show about a guy eating a live squid. Yuck!
1,Well_comma_ I guess one night without beer is not going to kill you.  
1,That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong! 
1,I recently got promoted at work.
1,Yeah_comma_ I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.
1,I think I'd look into entering some eating contests if I were you!
1,No_comma_ I'm not. I'm hopeful that the deniers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth.
1,It's crazy the amount of drivers running a red light near my house every day. 
1,yea i was impressed how quick he was
1,Wow you were able to do that?
1,I'm happy that you have this opportunity in life. Keep at it and be thankful for it.
1,My kids will sometimes go and play at my new neighbors house. 
1,Thank you_comma_ maybe I need to find a more expensive alternative then haha.
1,Why? Is there something wrong with the daycare?
1,I was in a car wreck on the way home from church.
1,That was rude. Did they stop
1,I was in the middle of a long distance move_comma_ and somehow misplaced my drivers registration and car insurance!!! 
1,Last weekend_comma_ I invited my friend over and we played FIFA on PS4. I won against him with a large score
1,I just ran home and hid underneath my bed. I looked out the window and it was on the street still staring at me. Now I can't leave my house!
1,Yeah I should. It's still hard. I feel like I let him down for not doing the favour
1,when my brother loves the things i love _comma_ it makes me feel good like we are bonding 
1,I am hoping for a raise with my evaluation next week.  Fingers crossed.  It was a good year though.
1,Well that was nice of you_comma_ glad you took the dogs in.
1,Well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly
1,Oh wow! I like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things_comma_ it's such a thrill. Especially rock climbing - I had a friend who made me do it once too
1,It makes me feel the same. That's why I voted for myself in the last election.
1,Because of the movie or where you were parked?
1,"I  left most of my belongings at a hostel for 2 months. Everything was still there when I got back."""
1,because she wanted to give you a surprise present
1,i would be mad_comma_ since i just it to make money online 
1,I see. So you miss them. Call them?
1,Hopefully it brought back good ones. Were you close to them?
1,Nope_comma_ i just see so many depressing stories on the news
1,O yeah? What did you find?
1,I hope she would find one as it seems now the economy is really competitive
1,Maybe you can invite someone every now and then_comma_ like a neighbor or someone you trust.
1,I am faithful to my wife_comma_ but it's thought.
1,I was jumping with joy when it happened
1,That's great! I must have been so cool to see that!
1,Oh no_comma_ was you able to get pregnant?
1,I have knee problems and a coworker don't stop making jokes the way I am walking. He making very angry each time.
1,Ah_comma_ I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
1,They looked so nice. And it was in a real theater so it seemed so professional. 
1,I got concert tickets for my birthday. I thought the show was sold out. My girlfriend got them for me.
1,It's always nice to have someone show you things. You're very lucky.
1,Maybe he wants you to work the weekend.
1,I can't believe what happened to my dog.
1,I have no idea how long'd been there.  I just can't get over that there was more than one.
1,That is a great accomplishment!
1,Ahh_comma_ maybe you can ask your boss for a raise instead? Haha
1,I'm glad you made that connection.
1,I am a Cowboys fan.  I can't wait for it!
1,New people make me so nervous.
1,I ordered a dress for a party and it was arriving the same day as the event.
1,she would purposely pee in the bed
1,I bet that was scary!
1,Oh that's too bad. I am sure you felt bad_comma_ but your son probably understood.
1,so sweet of you and sounds like a lot of fun enjoy! 
1,Good deal!  I am happy to help!
1,It's cool. It's not for everyone. I'm a nerd at heard so I love science fiction.
1,I found my old yearbook yesterday
1,I always have a nice time driving my old truck.
1,I hope its better than you expect!
1,I just had crab legs for lunch.
1,I don't think it ever came out right. They really messed up. 
1,Sorry to hear that. Sounds like sleep for you might not be in the cards tonight?
1,What's going on next week?
1,i remember being a kid when the first one came out
1,That's so lucky! How much did you win?
1,I did_comma_ that was the scary part! I was in the back of the store and I watched it all unfold. I secretly dialed 911.
1,I was kicked out of the class and got a zero on the test
1,Wow.  Well_comma_ if that was the culture and climate of that workplace_comma_ you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad.
1,"It was ""money""! I hope that means she is going to be successful one day."
1,I live with her now.  In fact she's sitting right next to me this very moment.
1,Excellent! Any scholarships in the future?
1,Yeah I felt really prepared.  I knew going into it that I had done everything I needed to _comma_ and felt good about my abilities.
1,They definitely like me there.
1,Indeed it can. they've not a nasty howl too
1,I think you will make it
1,I am too. It's gotten me every where I needed to go and rarely gave me trouble.
1,Very inspirational story. They make good money too.
1,Yep_comma_ those were the days.
1,Me too - this one was on BBC. It was interesting.
1,good to hear that_comma_ what is interesting
1,I had to sit with a dying dog at the rescue today.   It was sad but I felt like he deserved to be loved on before he passed away
1,I found a nice pair of jeans at the store that fit just right.
1,He was sitting on a perch looking hungry. He asked for money but I didnt have any so I gave his a slice of pizza and he cursed me out.
1,I can't wait for my birthday
1,Just visiting. Think we're gonna wing it.
1,Sometimes I do a weird thing to cheer myself up.
1,My schools acceptance letter to my program I wanted to join.
1,That is great to hear.  What is making you so happy?
1,Yeah - that's good too. I just fancied a change.
1,Yes! It was an experience of a lifetime! He still has concerts scheduled for later this year as well!
1,They couldn't take off work due to unexpected project problems.
1,Croatia should have won! I always support them!
1,ugh I just want to crawl into a hole. my whole school knows too
1,It got distemper and couldn't shake it.  I will buy another one some day.  I think I need a little time though.
1,that had to be a long time ago
1,What elephant? This is a random chatroom experience that I had?
1,Does it have some cool features?
1,Nice! I hope you guys did a lot of catching up!
1,It hurt me when my brother moved away. I could not handle it
1,Yeah he is a cute one. Problem is that I saw the puppy eating out of the cat's litter box.
1,That is terrible.  How do they get away with it?
1,Absolutely_comma_ she's always been good to me and has never given me reason to not trust her. 
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm worried that he might find something wrong. I don't know what but the possibility is always there.
1,I was just informed that my computer software is now being used in a school :)
1,I love peruvian food! What did you make?
1,Oh no.  Did something happen?
1,I was reading the news the other day and I saw something so sad_comma_ about some Christians being persecuted in Nigeria. I guess something like 6_comma_000 families have been massacred by extremists. It made me feel awful and sick.
1,Although my life isn't going very well right now_comma_ at least I have a roof over my head and food to eat. Many people in the world don't even have those two things.
1,Grocery shopping today was the worst
1,that is incredible! congrats is she your first?
1,My dog_comma_ which I had for about 15 years passed away last week. I miss her so much. My home feels empty without her around.
1,How did you like it?
1,Lol. Do you see a lot of her?
1,They did!  That is so terrible!
1,I found out that a friend of mine from high school passed away recently.
1,Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as it's not a baby marriage.
1,i am just hopeful he will pay me back!!
1,Oh thank goodness you weren't late.
1,I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end?
1,They kind of went off on me ad disagreed. What I said wasn't offensive_comma_ just irrelevant though lol.
1,I don't think they will be sympathetic to my reasons.
1,We just bought a used car and we've already had to take it to the shop
1,I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now? 
1,Yea_comma_ she's a sweetheart. First cat I've ever owned and I realize now that I'm a cat person as opposed to a dog person.
1,does it bother you _comma_ when you are single and all your friends are in relationships and happy _comma_ its kind of annoying lol
1,Yes_comma_ I know.  I'm glad I had a car so that I could go pick him up_comma_ but it's so scary at first.  And then when I got to the school_comma_ having to wait for them to tell me where he was was so nerve wracking!
1,Its for a restaraunt here in town.  So i've got a couple of free meals 
1,Aw that's so sweet. Did you find one to make?
1,What is you job now?
1,i feel so proud of all that my husband and i have accomplished together
1,Very!  It costs thousands less than replacing.
1,I am sorry for your loss. She is taking it hard
1,It was. I felt so relaxed and one with nature.
1,Maybe_comma_ but I'm not sure when another opportunity like this will come. It really gets me down
1,How long ago was it?
1,Yeah I don't blame you.  Time to find some new friends!
1,I went to the movies and peed in my pants.
1,I broke up with my partner of 2 years about two month ago. I think loneliness is the worst that could happen to a human being
1,Thank you so much :D
1,Hey you should give that back
1,It went so much better than expected_comma_ she loves me back!
1,Yea_comma_ I really don't mind taking them off but still I thought I enunciated the request properly.
1,I have only played a couple times. It is impressive how much energy they have and how good their accuracy is.
1,I'm hesitant because I get nervous in front of groups.
1,Hey there_comma_ Got to admit_comma_ I'm pretty lonely right now. 
1,Yeah.  I was surprise at how well he could maneuver that thing around though!
1,My son showed up at our door unexpectedly one day. He is in the Army and stationed in California!
1,I probably will!  Or throw up lol
1,I feel really hurt and sad.
1,That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have
1,Well_comma_ that's frustrating. Hopefully next time she'll think more about how her actions affect you.
1,You'll be alright_comma_ make sure to talk to your coworkers or you'll feel lonely like me!
1,It is very important to stay close to family.
1,I tripped at the gym the other day. I turned around and about five people saw me. I felt stupid.
1,Not even a nickel. I regret going lol
1,He was working and forgot.
1,I'm sorry_comma_ but that made me laugh a little bit. I've never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they're so independent and determined to do whatever the want. Doesn't seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them.
1,No_comma_ I never win! I didn't expect this lol
1,A wide reciever in a football game made a one handed catch.
1,Yeah_comma_ I didn't get caught but took it back anyway.
1,Finding things to be grateful for have saved my sanity
1,thats pretty neat.  I think that might be worth a lot of money
1,I hope it was a good day for you_comma_ atleast you did something productive and got some laundry done haha
1,We took a big leap of faith with our teenage son this weekend. We left him home overnight alone for the first time.
1,It's a charter school. That means that it is public_comma_ but that they focus more on academic and a classic education. Less common core.
1,Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST
1,I think he is not the reason. It is democrats who play race as a political card too frequently. They should do it less often
1,Right or something you really need but can't easily pick up locally. 
1,i hope the kid stays with it too_comma_ it will give him a lot of discipline and useful skills in life like self confidense 
1,Back in school_comma_ I studied a lot for an important exam. But_comma_ still I was very much worried about my test results.
1,Its not like they can go anywhere so back on up!
1,Well that's sweet. I bet they love you
1,What did you get started doing?
1,Life was so good during my childhood. I lived carefree and oblivious to challenges.
1,That's awesome. I want a baby nephew :(
1,Wow_comma_ how exciting. Are you going to go?
1,Thats great! Did he enjoy doing it?
1,Why would they take it off air? it was a great show
1,When i see  people leave their parents in oldage home. I get furious
1,I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now. 
1,Last week at work I kept hearing people laughing when I walked by. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at.
1,It better. Babysitters are cheap.
1,Was it the company with the Gecko?
1,That is so cool_comma_ what kind of video game was it?
1,Tell him you had to go to the store!
1,We were just growing apart too much.
1,Wow_comma_ that's quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you?
1,That sounds like a really cool idea. I hope that it turns out well!
1,That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a great time?
1,"My coworkers all went together and gave me an expensive gift card."""
1,Yeah it's going to be great!
1,I expect that too_comma_ but it is not always the case.
1,I agree_comma_ and I am so impressed by all this new technology.
1,I'm not sure what you mean_comma_ but disntance does tend to make things more difficult
1,What do you do for fun do you have a significant other?
1,I think I'm a hermit but most times feel sad that I don't have a social life.
1,Ugghhh!  My neighbor's dog has gone to the bathroom in my yard again!!
1,And it takes 4 years or more. Im still debating grad school.
1,i took a pregnancy test just to find out it was negative
1,Did you at least honk your horn?
1,My brother recently told me that once_comma_ when we were kids_comma_ he spit in my orange juice and let me drink it.
1,Absolutely.  I played my guitar_comma_ we sang_comma_ we talked_comma_ and just enjoyed the night.  God has been good to me.  Life is good.  
1,What does it not do right?
1,Congrats! How long have you been with your company?
1,I live the life of my dreams.  As a result I've got a lot of haters so I'm always ready to knock out a jealous little punk who tries crossing me at all times
1,awww. don't tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also.
1,I used to have the same problem_comma_ I'd always hear a bunch of spooky noises after everyone left.
1,I don't really know. He just seemed so discheviled and alone.
1,I can understand being humiliated in the moment. Thankfully most kids grow out of that phase!
1,Thanks for the well wishes.  I know I have it for sure!
1,Is it your first time there?
1,When i lost my money I felt lost
1,Your next adventure will go much smoother. I once got a really bad rash in Hawaii when I visited.
1,It's a horrible addiction that I always keep putting off correcting.  I plan to make an effort to quit tomorrow.
1,You must really trust her to let her hold on to your life's savings!
1,I might regret being so happy right now when she's talking non stop lol
1,yeah thats annoying _comma_ its happened to me before
1,I feel so ready for this exam.
1,Noice! Ha ha_comma_ that's so funny.  I have a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee.....I bet its like night and day! Take that baby out and ride it with the windows down and the music up!
1,I watched a horror movie and I was afraid at night
1,I would too.  What had happened?
1,I've been laid up all day with an illness so it's good to be talking to someone.
1,yeah_comma_ im gonna have to go shorter_comma_ i realize everyone can't do hair. 
1,Yes it is very hot and humid where I am. Always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice_comma_ cool house!
1,The way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work.
1,That would have made me sad _comma_ poor kitten 
1,now how nice of you!! thats what  are friends for. I Hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift!!
1,Yeah it feels like the pace is too quick to even stop and enjoy like we used to in those days.
1,Yeah_comma_ a really big and bad lie
1,It's finally raining after weeks of hot humid weather_comma_ I'm so relieved.
1, My grandma becomes too old and depend on others for her needs.
1,I'm not sure! Nobody has been able to give me a clear answer_comma_ not even the workers outside.
1,It was a long time ago now.
1,Oh_comma_ well sometimes we say things we don't mean. If you apologize he'll probably accept it and be fine again.
1,Oh! That's something to look forward to then! decide what your gonna do? 
1,Thank you. No_comma_ my grown children were there. They made a slide show of hubby and I over the years. Brought tears to my eyes. 
1,I know but I wasn't expecting it.. and it looked like my mom.
1,i once got lost in a big city with no cell battery_comma_ scary
1,I am overcome by joy when I'm with my son's
1,I fell bad about myself because I voted on Trump for president and I regret immensaly 
1,Oh no_comma_ that's a horrible feeling
1,Yes that's the worst. And I laughed when I read that. 
1,I like the little roller coasters myself.
1,You are lucky_comma_ and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.
1,I just got some crushing news. I just got a call to tell me I did not get the job I really wanted.
1,Oh sweet! I'd love to go to one of their shows myself. I hope you have a great time.
1,I was supposed to be going on vacation_comma_ but one of my coworkers quit suddenly.
1,someone almost crashed into me today
1,Did you ask why your partner refused. That is very weird.
1,I wanted a friend to help me to move to my new apartment but he didn't help me as he said.
1,She sounds like she enjoyed it though lol
1,Did the entire class laugh at you?
1,In freshman year of college_comma_ me and some friends got invited to this really sketchy party and we were really hesitant about going.
1,I told my husband that I was going to see a friend when I didn't. I went to a party planner's place.
1,My mom said that too lol
1,I would never go to that place again. Did you go to a different place?
1,Can you make new friends where you are now?
1,Oh my_comma_ did you find out who it was?
1,Did he come to pick you up?
1,I hope you don't have to put your friend down_comma_ accidents happen.
1,That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying?
1,He is 2 and a half. He was born a month early too_comma_ so when he hits milestones its always really cool for us.
1,It is always good to have someone that will help you in time of needs.
1,My best friend recently moved to another state and I haven't seen her in a while
1,I got $20 worth of Taco Bell. I haven't ate all day.
1,it was great... taught her and she was calling me telling me all about him snitching her out...lol

1,Yeah_comma_ I don't know if it's just my specific college's requirement or what.. I can see it being useful in my major since I'll have to interact with people in my profession_comma_ and some of them could be foreign. It's still nerve-wracking.

1,I ordered some chicken the other day and I had ate some before I realized it was still pink.
1,I was really stressed out_comma_ because I had information with a lot of money on it.

1,I was sitting on a plane next to an older man_comma_ who was telling me about how he had just visited his father_comma_ but that it was sad because he has dementia and didn't remember him anymore. I was trying to comfort him_comma_ mostly because I worry it will happen to my dad_comma_ too.

1,Thats bad timing for sure
1,I can never do anything or go anywhere unless I know all the steps needed and have everything set out.
1,I've never had the guts to do that_comma_ even though I've wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
1,Well_comma_ it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them.

1,I kept all of my kids first day pics every year. They are in a book
1,Well_comma_ sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isn't drama_comma_ but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people?

1,I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
1,It would drive me crazy also_comma_ she should be more considerate. 
1,It really is.  The 'opposition' really hates me so she is trying to keep from them.
1,I was shocked when my parents got me a car for graduation
1,I have been talking to this girl that I like for awhile now.  I think that I am finally going to ask her on a date
1,What are they doing tomorrow?

1,I have been feeling down since my great grandmother passed.
1,Least year I took my final performance exam for my pilot's license.  I thought it was going to be easy.  I was wrong.
1,When I'm driving around and I see a stray dog or cat_comma_ I feel so bad that I can't help but stop to pick them up and bring them home! I can't believe how many people neglect their pets!

1,Sounds like you are a really great friend
1,Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May?

1,Yea I was a little bummed out.
1,California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.
1,There is so much different kinds it can be daunting sometimes on where to find the good stuff.
1,That's awesome. Sounds like you were well prepared for it.

1,I watched a man eat a 5 pound ham.
1,Unfortunately I had my shirt tucked in and I was wearing skinny jeans so everyone noticed they just didn't tell me.  I was wearing my superman undies too so it was extra noticeable...humiliating.
1,I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets are just like family.
1,My dog ran away yesterday. I've never been so distraught in my life!
1,It must have been very devastating. But remember him for all the good times.

1,One of the scariest things that happened to me was when I slept through a physics quiz that I really needed to do well on.
1,Oh he's still nice. He has some issues_comma_ though_comma_ but I love him very much of course.
1,It was an accident at the storage faciltiy
1,I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too_comma_ because you're parked and probably not even there_comma_ so you were completely powerless in the situation_comma_ and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out_comma_ since you just purchased it.
1,Oh_comma_ really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be. 
1,oh my god man_comma_ was it hot?

1,LOOOLLL I'm the same way I hate their lack of willpower!
1,That's true_comma_ but they've all been high school sweethearts. So it's unlikely. I wish I found someone back then
1,I hope you get it next year. Good luck.
1,They found it at Kmart. Who would've thought I would get it back after 5 years of it being lost?
1,At least you have learned your lesson_comma_ I hope? 
1,Yeah_comma_ it's crazy to think how long ago some things are
1,I received a package yesterday and the contents were destroyed!
1,I bet you are scared! It will be fun though!
1,I would love that too
1,I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack.
1,I am getting frustrated with my job recently_comma_ they are overworking us
1,Very lucky. I won't make that mistake again
1,Oh_comma_ nice. Do you have a car?
1,that is unfortunate_comma_ hopefully you can give them guidance
1,I cried when the office and it and theres a totally different show
1,No I am really jealous!  I have wanted to go there for the longest time.  I am happy for you!
1,That's always fun_comma_ to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they?
1,She moved away for a couple years 
1,That is such a bizarre story.
1,I probably shouldn't have_comma_ but I let go the wheel and let autopilot steer my car for 2 miles
1,yeah but i think i am going to miss her and feel alone
1,Good thing he wasn't drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident. Alcohol really impairs motor skills.

1,Yep_comma_ we will be grilling hot dogs and hamburgers_comma_ and jet-skiing!
1,I hope so. Although I also wish I could take it back lol
1,No one has ever given me a car. That must be nice
1,I just heard a friend from work is switching shifts so we are no longer going to be working together. Bummer.
1,I give the credit more to Obama than Trump.The economy is doing great despite Trump
1,I can understand that. Sometimes one person's dream is another person's pain.
1,I can not even imagine how that would be.
1,I have a job interview scheduled for Friday. I really want the job. It is making me so nervous.
1,Chuky Candy bar_comma_ Twinkies _comma_ and some sour patch straws lol.

1,Somewhat_comma_ but I am confident they will come back okay.
1,I've never made it myself but_comma_ I've had it before.  ITs fantastic.
1,I cannot wait for weeks from now. College football is starting

1,I was content going on vacation last weekend. It was very calming
1,My parents planned a welcoming party for me when I returned from college without telling me!
1,To be honest_comma_ they shouldn't ahve trusted me.

1,Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas
1,MY daughter is growing so fast.
1,Me either. It is going to be interesting.
1,Really? What sort of things have you done that make you feel that way?
1,Yes! Great reviews. The former one just wasn't inspected even though it said it was. Stuff happens_comma_ but really I need a vacuum and it's cheaper to get them online
1,Wow_comma_ congratulations! That is a pretty competitive league as well
1,My cat pooped on the bed the other day_comma_ I threw away the sheet
1,No good_comma_ any idea what you're gonna do?
1,Not in time. The deadline came and I still needed about 3-6 more months. My boss said we should ask for an extension_comma_ but I knew those were rarely given.
1,Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude. 
1,They are converse and I have so many I didn't need to try them on. Well actually I did need too lol
1,We are from northwest Louisiana

1,Oh no haha_comma_ were you prepared for it?
1,They were just not nice and did not want anything to do with me
1,Yes it is sad. It was hard when she told me and my mom to enjoy my son because she will never have grandkids. I think my heart broke when she said that. 
1,I found a old tool box with my grandfather's tools in it in the garage.
1,My parents had difficulties conceiving as well. What happened in the end?
1,I was leaning back in my chair at work and fell over.
1,Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied? 
1,lol. she is upset about everything all of time. I couldnt have been that way lol
1,No. My mom and I were hanging out sipping on red wine and I decided to try the dress on for her. That's when I tripped and spilled the wine on the front of my dress.
1,I thought I followed the instructions correctly_comma_ but turned out a lot different what it was suppose to.  Oh well
1,Good. Where are you going?
1,I was so scared to go to sleep when I was a kid. I was afraid of the dark.
1,You must have been so impressed. They must have been quite talented.
1,I am! I've been working so hard with him lately! 
1,Its for college. If I don't pass it is going to affect my graduation negatively
1,So many people cheat nowadays. That's good to hear!
1,I just never do it. I want to wear a two peice bikini one summer lol
1,The police is aware of the situation but they are doing nothing.
1,I am sorry to hear that.What is the reason for this?
1,I think I will do that tomorrow
1,Cool! that's what I always do on my birthday too! LOL
1,It was but I found everything I needed before going. Too bad it always takes so long at those offices.
1,Yeah I had it fenced up for a couple weeks till I thought it was good_comma_ the first day I take it down... wasted.
1,I'm so happy that my cousin got a full ride scholarship! She really worked hard for this chance to be successful!
1,Thats horrible. I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time.
1,Thanks! She loves rollercoasters! I can't wait to take her.
1,Nice_comma_ do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free?
1,I am a huge fan of sharks_comma_ and I am thrilled to go to the new shark film coming out!
1,She got it too. She was able to work at the schools summer camp and get a free week of camp herself!
1,Well you can with the next job
1,I was shocked when I wsa told my boss was let go
1,Don't worry_comma_ you'll do great! You're very articulate and confident.
1,Yes_comma_ but I was quite late. and got yelled at by my teacher.
1,I've been working hard as a waiter this summer. Kind of fun since it's helped me develop social skills.. One person even tipped me $25 when their order was only like $8. Caught me off-guard that someone wanted to be that nice to me
1,Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?
1,Who are they you are referring
1,I took a candy bar from a child.
1,oh yea same_comma_ its been a while
1,Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it_comma_ I could have downed a gallon of the stuff.
1,I'm sure you are doing an amazing job_comma_ you seem to care which makes you a great parent.
1,I entered a bowling tournament and felt I had a pretty good chance to do well.
1,Maybe she will start paying on time.

1,we used to not get along so well_comma_ but now we are like joined at the hip
1,One time I drove all the way to work_comma_ just to be told they changed the schedule and I wasn't supposed to be there.
1,it seems like every other family in my daughter's class lives in a mansion.
1,i bet. that would be a bummer for anyone
1,Yeah working retail is not easy
1,That is disappointing.  What kind of laptop is it?
1,Yes cruises are awesome. I am sure you will enjoy it.
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow! 
1,A lot of them were still pretty good_comma_ but I think my fondness for them largely hinges on my memories of reading them as a kid.
1,Yeah I have a minivan with bumper stickers boasting of all her accomplishments. I am her #1 fan!
1,Cool. Are you in charge?
1,Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also.

1,you sure will_comma_ besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3
1,That sounds right to me. I actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that.
1,My two daughters keep me happy.
1,I'm sorry to heat that. That's something that can't be replaced. 
1,My friend was scheduled to work with me the other day and I was really excited.
1,I forgot my words when giving a speech. I completely messed up!
1,It's the least I can do. My kids grow out of their clothes before they can tear them up and they get bored with toys quickly so why not?
1,Me and my wife have been to have a child for the past year. I just learned last week that I can't have kid. It is terrible.
1,Did you all have a good time there?
1,My son wanted the tips of his new hair curt dyed blonde to start school.
1,I was sad when I had to give away my dog. The place I was going to did not allow animals

1,I didn't get the promotion at work_comma_ I cant believe Becky got it over me... I'm really upset about it.
1,My dog pooped on the rug yesterday.
1,I wasn't nervous because I was so sure of myself.
1,I miss when I was a child. I didn't have to do anything besides school and play with my friends.
1,i dont see it that way _comma_ but everyone has there own views 
1,Is it an absolute mess inside?
1,I was surprised when Roger Federer lost the 2018 Wimbledon quarters

1,Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special? 
1,I like to write and play music. I've been practicing a new song and I know I'm ready to play it on stage in front of people
1,I agree. I thinking making a list helps with that.
1,just like birth_comma_ death is the start of another process unclear to us_comma_ the unseen_comma_ and i believe in this deeply_comma_ your mother is fine_comma_ she is always there
1,Oh man that's rough... maybe you should think about moving?
1,true! I don't mind the same things. You can do healthy_comma_ it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy
1,Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it? 
1,Condolences it is very sad to lose a grandparent_comma_ they are so special to us
1,Well_comma_ I hope the job is close to where you live. Long commutes are the worst_comma_ and they can take away from your personal time.
1,its crazy! I ran into my ex at the grocery store.  She has kids now_comma_ so that was weird.  We talked about some of our old memories.  It was fun thinking about the past and imagining what could have been.
1,I cooked a big meal for my whole family tonight. I was so glad when my niece cleaned up afterwards. I really appreciated it.
1,I find spiders to be extremely creepy
1,There's nothing like it. It's exhausting but in the back of your mind you know there's nothing better.
1,I came in last in the race_comma_ I am not good at running.
1,Aw :( I bet other people appreciate you a lot!
1,That will help him alot
1,Oh yes I was. He does well in school as well.

1,The cool breezes_comma_ and the falling leaves.
1,She works at a marketing Company.She is very talented.
1,thats cool that he was able to come out on his own terms
1,That's so rare in teenagers! Sounds like you did a great job raising him.
1,I felt bad when I saw a stray dog on the road. I almost had to stop
1,i run 1 10k a year lol
1,That's good.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  People should be begging for your attention. Not the other way around ;)
1,I peed in the sink because the bathrooms were full and i really had to go
1,I've been getting back into it. I'm near the coast so its fun to go.
1,Yay that is awesome! Sometimes not knowing the gender of the baby is a very cool surprise they say.
1,I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking. 
1,My car was stolen last night!
1,You know it!  They should have to pay me for the work I missed!
1,Hey_comma_ we all pig out at some point
1,That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean?

1,Thank you_comma_ I didn't realize I could to that!
1,Yes_comma_ everything is covered including some money for food! 
1,I enjoy football_comma_ but I mainly enjoy that when football happens_comma_ fall comes.
1,I'm sorry to hear that. What were you worried about?
1,I'm having a difficult time doing even basic tasks for myself due to anxiety. But i'm hopeful that something good will happen for me. I feel bad about complaining about anxiety after finding out your mother is ill.
1,It is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on.
1,I am so happy for you!
1,I've always been loyal to my wife and children above all else.
1,Thanks. It wouldve been a good thing if he didn't call last month to tell me happy birthday also. He should know when my birthday is after 11 years lol
1,I am tired of paying bills lol
1,Yea_comma_ it's a bit stressful to get ready_comma_ but it goes smoothly once it begins I think.
1,So proud of my mother!
1,I'm so made at George Lucas. How could he think something like the Phantom Menace would be a good idea for a movie!
1,yea i was super thankful that he helped me
1,A mommy deer got hit by a car in front of my house and her two babies keep hanging around looking for her. I'm afraid they're going to go in the road like she did and get killed. Ugh.
1,My birthday was last week and I thought everyone forgot about it.
1,That makes sense. I'm not paying for this lol
1,They are very strange. I don't understand that selfishness. People work all different days and hours. Of course he doesn't have the nerve to go yell at the people who set off fireworks all night after 10. 
1,I am sorry. I am sure he appreciates you being there for him
1,my brother graduated high school last year which was cool.
1,yeah me too thank you for that _comma_ i feel a whole lot better now after time passed - time for the most all heals all 
1,Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?

1,A co-worker is my blood brother. I am is line manager
1,I agree. I am so thankful.
1,I'm glad! It's the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again_comma_ too. So in the end_comma_ they have someone who's sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor.
1,Oh man! I've been there. That is hard. I hope it wasn't too long!
1,Cox a poor man is automatically an Angry man
1,I know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too.. i hope you get to be together again soon. 
1,Yes_comma_ Sounds like you deserve one! Keep working hard and show them you earned it.
1,that's not good at all _comma_ have you tried asking for someones car?
1,I have to have some medical tests done and I'd like to get them over with as soon as possible.
1,really? i tortoise? i have one in my backyard too!
1,That is scary_comma_ what are you going to do about it?
1,Good_comma_ I am glad there is still true love out there!
1, I decided to try and fix it which I did successfully. Yesterday I spilled my drink on the carpet and used my now fixed steam cleaner to clean up. glad I didn't get rid of it
1,Of course. Well karma will get them one day. At least it wasn't a full on accident where you could've gotten injured.
1,Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.  That'll teach him not to brag
1,Yes! They are awesome and I feel so much better.
1,Thanks. I am the goalie.
1,That sounds exciting! Will you be meeting your old friends there?
1,Do you know who sent them?
1,My pet iguana died he was 15 years old..
1,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can replace them soon.
1,No one showed up for my birthday
1,Well_comma_ I am sorry you had to witness that. Admittedly_comma_ it 
1,Cool. Most people dont like training.
1,I think for half the day people could see my underwear. I went and bought one
1,I do_comma_ yeah! I'm still nervous about them_comma_ but it usually ends up being okay.
1,Does his phone not work or something?
1,Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.
1,I got very annoyed in teh supermarket last week
1,We have a signs business and I am also a travel agent.
1,Right_comma_ yeah_comma_ you just get used to their presence. I hated that they'd bark so much at thunderstorms_comma_ but other than that_comma_ their little quirks were growing on me. In fact_comma_ I miss them right now
1,She indeed is. I knew she was kind hearted but even this surprised me.
1,My Ac went out a month ago. I knew it was gonna be during the summer.
1,What do you like to do on the lake?
1,Oh definitely. Why did you?
1,That's really tough right now. I hope you're doing something fun to keep yourself occupied.
1,Hmm.. what's that mean? Do you feel like you did something wrong?
1,Hopefully_comma_ you pass at least.
1,I think it is just the noise of the buzzer that makes him nervous_comma_ but he literally just screams and cries. It definitely doesn't hurt him at all.
1,It all hit me while I was walking out of an Eddie Bauer store at the mall.  I had to waddle to the bathroom and throw away my underwear.
1,Did it get worse or better?
1,One of friend didn't come to my birthday party.
1,I did not know it was ending_comma_ sorry to hear that!
1,That's fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
1,Yes_comma_ and none of my co-workers told me! I would hope someone would let me know!
1,No they didn't return it and covered up that they took it. And we don't speak any more.
1,It was in front of a lot of important higher-ups so I didn't want to make myself look bad. Luckily they turned out to be really nice individuals!
1,I have a long drive planned.  About 9 hours.  I hate long drives :/
1,they are friendly once they get to know you.. but when they tense up their spikes can hurt sometimes
1,My friends went to a bar tonight and I didn't get to go.
1,I think you did fine_comma_ even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess_comma_ hopefully your subconscious remembered more. 
1,That is awesome!  Congratulations!  So_comma_ you are prepared for everything that is about to happen?
1,Nope i'm quite content to be here as long as I can.
1,Yah_comma_ lost my job and trying to find a new one.
1,Yes_comma_ I am going with my best friend.
1,wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving 
1,The other day I ate an entire pizza. I felt so bad

1,Yes_comma_ Now days_comma_ most neighbors don't talk to each other.

1,But you just said you do like them.
1,It is a Mazda RX8 and it is one of my favorite cars.
1,It's nice to work with people who care
1,Oh no_comma_ did it end up okay?

1,She learned all by herself too. I am not talented like that
1,I've struggled with my weight for years and my ability to stick to a diet_comma_ but for the past four months I have been very dedicated to a new diet approach! I'm seeing amazing results.
1,Oh I see _comma_ what happens then?
1,That awful!  Were you able to continue without it?  That must have really messed up your rhythm.
1,Why its okay to be differnt
1,I had picked out some school shoes for my daughter the other day and was waiting for my check to hit the bank so that I could order them.
1,Yeah that is true sadly
1,Oh man_comma_ good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life
1,Luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice.
1,Yeah_comma_ sweet is a way to describe it. It's this sickly strange garbage smell that exists nowhere else in nature_comma_ and I hate it.
1,I know.  It's just so hard to see when innocent children are victims.  It breaks my heart.
1,Hi friend_comma_ I'm pretty upset right now.
1,I sure am_comma_ life is good at the moment
1,why the feeling nolstalgia maybe ?
1,I didn't want to make things awkward_comma_ so I didn't. Hopefully I'll be next in line!

1,I am going on a cruise to the Bahamas.  Ive been getting ready all day.
1,Oh_comma_ yuck! They will do that_comma_ but sure don't want puppy kisses later.
1,I hate when that happens
1,I was thinking of getting Samsung S9 which costs around $700 and thought of paying with my Amex credit card

1,That's too bad. If you want_comma_ you can reach out to them. 
1,I was parking my car today and someone just cut in from of me a took my place. How rude can you get?
1,Hey my girlfriend of 5 years dumped me last week.
1,"I still don't know!  We've been dealing with it for months.  I've lived here for years.  What makes me so mad though is that they all keep telling me ""well it is hot outside"" Well yessss I know that!"
1,My son just took his first steps.
1,I am sure you had a really good reason right?
1,I got a statistics tutor over the summer
1,Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks_comma_ then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.  
1,Yes_comma_ I am so sad she's leaving!
1,I cant believe that I won $100 on a scratch off ticket. I think I am going to buy a new pair of shoes with it. I cant wait to go cash it in.

1,I miss having a man at home
1,yes they are very nice
1,A blue 67 mustang drove by earlier and it reminded me of the one my dad had when I was a kid.
1,You should take it somewhere then
1,Yuck. I suppose some people need to do that to survive though
1,WHAT? Do live in california?
1,The culture that extends adolescence deep into their twenties doesn't help much either. 
1,You ever had strawberry shortcake ice cream?
1,Oh no really_comma_ that really sucks to hear. Why were you not able to go?
1,Yeah she is very excited_comma_ she's having twin boys. I can't wait to be an uncle!
1,I can't wait to get out of these work clothes and into my sweats
1,Why is she the love of your life?
1,Did you manage to get it?
1,I'm making guacamole for the first time.
1,Absolutely_comma_ and if you can start with a game for them too that would help.
1,wow_comma_ you might just have bad luck
1,I don't know if its weird but I am most comfortable laying in bed watching TV and hanging out from there.
1,I bet_comma_ its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work?
1,That can be rough. I know I've dealt with that with my kids by giving them each 10 minutes of solo time before they go to bed. Allows them to get their energy out.
1,No_comma_ I just though she wouln't get along with the other people I had_comma_ but I still feel bad I didn't even tell her about the party.
1,cool_comma_ hopefully she does and yall have fun
1,Oh yeah? What is going to be your hallmark meal?
1,Well_comma_ hopefully y'all will still be able to keep in touch.
1,Yup i totally get you_comma_ it's same here and now it feels time is going super slow_comma_ these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her_comma_ make sure you enjoy yourself!
1,I had to get my foot looked at by the doctor_comma_ always makes me nervous going there.
1,I am sure you will
1,Lol.  I love it.  That is a great way to remind her of why she shouldn't lie.
1,I hope so too because it is so not good not been able to buy anything
1,because we are only on one income and its not enough for our family 
1,Yeah I hope this is the one that sticks
1,It's not fair at all.
1,I had a rough day today and now my son refuses to go to bed
1,I bought my fiancee a big cake for her birthday.
1,Yeah_comma_ it was a house party and it was a great time despite my original thoughts.
1,That's awesome! How did it go?
1,I got pulled over and I was given a speeding ticket for going 55 in a 50MPH zone.
1,Ah okay_comma_ doesn't sound fun. Hope you did well and everything went smoothly!
1,im exhausted from work _comma_ they gave me such a giant work loud _comma_ i was surprised at myself for even finishing 
1,Sorry I meant frog. He was on the sink handle and I almost touched it!
1,Customer service is very important_comma_ and it seems like that place needs to work on that.
1,I would be so embarrassed. I would have probably done the same thing_comma_ but I would feel so guilty.
1,Oh_comma_ you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much.
1,I finished last semester with a 3.5 GPA. I cant believe I did that well. All that hard work paid off.

1,Awh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school? 
1,that's so great! lots of hard work i bet.
1,I hope they do and everything is ok
1,That he got out and he was unable to find him.  Things are known to go missing when my brother in law is around.  We should have known better.
1,Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?
1,Yes_comma_ and I enjoy it.
1,It's always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people.
1,How many people are invited? and where is it gonna be?
1,They usually are. Who's wedding did you go to?
1,That is awesome_comma_ I am sure it makes you happy
1,Yes_comma_ it gets me so irritated.
1,That is always a good feeling. I love when I am on top of things.
1,I had a great day at work today!  We are working on some pretty complex accounting_comma_ and I've had to do a lot of prep at night. 
1,The Strokes are playing this show on the fly in a month. It's so cool!

1,No_comma_ just a hassle to clean it all up
1,I think they're going to try one more time... we'll see.
1,Well I think it's really good you found such a cool think from your childhood
1,I'll try that first_comma_ but it's hard to report someone for just being really terrible in general.
1,My friend recently bought a brand new Mercedes.
1,Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments_comma_ I think it's how we respond that defines us_comma_ you know?
1,OMG! Bless your heart. I hope they feel guilty now knowing what they did to you. 
1,We were going to the lake for a weekend getaway since we haven't had some downtime in forever and then we got sick instead.
1,i ordered a limited editon tshirt from my favorite band and they sent the wrong size
1,Yesterday I came home to find that_comma_ my father got me a Mercedes!
1,I used to take gymnastics lessons_comma_ where the instructor would spot or make sure that we didn't fall when we tried to do new tricks. Thank god they were there because I wouldnt be alive from hitting my head when falling!

1,Oh boy. I know just how you feel. Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant?
1,Things were fine until 36 weeks.  Then all you know what happened.  I developed HELLP syndrome_comma_ my organs started shutting down_comma_ blood pressure was super high.  Had an emergency c-section and in the hospital for over a week after - came close to losing both of us.
1,Yeah I know_comma_ I bought his next meal after that one.

1,Thank you! You are so sweet! I hope so too. 
1,I am really happy with my tattoo artist. He is not charging me a lot for great work
1,It will be fine. Make sure you spend time with her and let her know that it will be okay. It can be helpful/
1,I was walking around with my brother on a Sunday_comma_ and I got into a pointless argument with him. I am disappointed that I left myself get caught up in it.
1,Thanks! I was happy to take care of her. Its the least we can do as children. 
1,I am shocked the Red Sox beat the Yankees today.
1,i am going to meet my soul mate this year
1,I'm sorry that happened. Do you still have contact with him?
1,Do you live on a farm? It will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens.
1,Yeah I didn't think I would be rooming with an adult 12 year old though.
1,He's the best! I had such a craving for chocolate. Plus it didn't hurt that we lived right down the street from Dairy Queen!
1,For sure. Not an avid listener_comma_ but definitely heard some of his stuff.
1,It was. I am so thankful that she is a part of my life.
1,Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!
1,Thank you I appreciate that. I just held him to such a high standard and he let me down. A lot.
1,I have a job interview coming up
1,Me too_comma_ The original Battle Royale.
1,I joined a dancing class
1,I know right. I would never act like that.
1,Sweet. I hope to meet you on the battlefield someday!

1,I agree_comma_ I love that feeling. What do you do for work?
1,That is cool I guess
1,That's never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember?
1,I already had one.  I took a fishing trip with some friends.
1,I take it up to my cabin in Michigan and hunt a bunch of small woodland critters! I like to think of myself as the hunter from Bambi.
1,I got happy when I knew I was going to six flags. I could hardly wait
1,my son took his first steps yesterday. he is not a baby anymore! that made me cry happy tears
1,It is. A lot of self doubt has crept into my head as of late and I'm trying to fight it off.
1,Yea I was shaking for such a long time after that. Next time I will try to be more cautious and make sure the driver sees me.
1,I really hope that you continue to encourage her! She may have a future as an artist.
1,Sorry to hear that! Definitely need to make sure it doesn't fall off!
1,what kind_comma_ is she alive?
1,That is great that you are going to take him. He will always remember it. 
1,That's a bummer. What happened once you moved there?
1,Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
1,So last night I was driving down this road and my car died and I had no lights.
1,I studied really hard for my test last week.
1,that is the worst. i am sorry to hear that.
1,Oh_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that.
1,I've never ran one before. I've been running at least 25 miles a week. Do you think i'm ready?
1,Ah_comma_ I see. Yeah_comma_ that's an easy habit to have. I would be that way too if I wasn't too cheap to spend money. I just try to do a lot of croc-pot stuff since I stink at cooking and am poor
1,None of the above:-) It was delivered by the Royal Mail.
1,I bent over and then they ripped in half.
1,yea i was so mad he even tried that garbage
1,it's the anniversary of my grandmother's death today
1,I am devastated my goldfish died. I cried for two days straight.
1,The other day I backed out of a parking spot and tapped a parked car.  It left a dent bit I left without notifying the owner.  It was not an action I am proud of.
1,We aren't supposed to_comma_ but I did anyway. Got to make the best out it.
1,Interesting...so as a mother do you get embarrassed if your son is too clingy in public?
1,My grandmother recently passed away. She had more flowers and grieving cards that we could have hoped for.
1,Yeah being with other adults can help
1,I am! She switched majors several times so it's been a long journey. She's finally figured it out though
1,a software engineer. I am so excited to be making so much more money!
1,I understand. is your new house far from the old one?
1,I had a fantasy draft today_comma_ i researched alot for it
1,Please never stay idle _comma_fix yourself anywhere_comma_ I mean somewhere
1,I don't kow anything about that. what happened?
1,Awww I am sorry.  At least she showed you how to make it!
1,It's just the fact that it's basically the same kind of stuff that in all of the other movies. 
1,I liked the buffetts the most!
1,SO frustrating. Hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner. Not sure they could/can *do* anything about it_comma_ but still -- maybe you've helped pay it forward to the next visitor!
1,I worked in the food court at the airport.
1,Who hasn't that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice_comma_ I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later?
1,Do you have home owners insurance?
1,What did you find out??
1,I won the opportunity to go up in a hot air balloon. Wonder who I should take with me.
1,They did_comma_ and I explained in as much detail as I could remember what he looked like. Hopefully they catch him.
1,Nice_comma_ i have friends there_comma_ i live in lavergne.
1,Great news.  Kids are always an exciting adventure!

1,One pleasant morning I saw the new roses blossom in my garden.
1,Oh good. I was going to ask how you felt about it.  Are you in college?

1,We have only one option when it comes to change_comma_ embrace it!
1,I would have been so embarrassed! Hopefully you didn't get hurt at all

1,I hated them as well
1,That was nice of her ha
1,he didn't punish you... he punished himself! That makes no sense

1,Sounds rather special to me! Out of the country or to another state? 
1,nothing its just my time to win
1,cheating on someone_comma_ to me_comma_ is so disgraceful
1,That's unfortunate_comma_ I wonder if he's forgiven them?
1,I can't wait for Friday to get here!
1,I recently went to a race at the local track
1,I could but it would be twice as expensive! I prefer buying things online as it's less of a hassle to return them if something is wrong. I don't have to drive anywhere
1,Don't have anywhere I need to go.

1,Oh yes it was it took me 6 days_comma_ but it was so much fun and I knew I could do it.

1,I can't wait.   I'm so sick of work right now.
1,Wow! When do you go?
1,I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.
1,That is awesome that she didn't make a big scene of it!
1,You ever have the situation where somebody buys doughnuts for your group_comma_ and somebody else eats the last one of the only flavor you like?
1,Last night was terrible! I heard a huge noise and was so scared I almost pooped my pants.
1,Today I had a lot to do on my job_comma_ I thought I was never going to finish on time. But then a coworker helped me with it.
1,Yeah_comma_ I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still_comma_ I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
1,I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?
1,false alarm. it was the neighbors cat at the window
1,Oh wow_comma_ thats impressive but I don't blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons.

1,I feel like you should to if you know you work hard go for it.
1,Yep_comma_ mama always said: work hard for that chocolate!
1,My radiator broke down in my car that I rely heavily on. 
1,Yes! It was a full blown small person in that cake!
1,yea the cgi in movies is stellar.
1,I do not like it at all. He takes her to lunch everyday and I think it is wrong.
1,I forget the lines in the school play. I was so embarrassed.
1,Omg I am so sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling at peace at all now? 
1,Good work. You must be feeling so healthy and fresh.
1,Last month I had to give a speech in front of a lot of people. I was nervous when I first found out.
1,It definitely is. I'm working hard to get it and hopefully won't have to worry about it again some time in my life.
1,That's pretty awesome :) is it your whole family going_comma_ or just you and a significant other
1,Wow_comma_ that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now?
1,It has been kind of fun looking at all the old photos and letters that she saved.
1,I am ready for the last day of work.
1,Did you call the police?
1,They are great. Except for my 13 year old. I look at her photos the most. She used to be a sweetheart.
1,ohh that's cool. I have never been there at such place. But_comma_ I am happy for you.
1,Did you move to the country?
1,I think at 3am the mind is truly it's sharpest and can make great content. I do understand the age thing though. Maybe slowly give her more time as she gets older. At 15 to 16 it gets hard to control all together.
1,Last week we had a fire start in our bathroom.
1,You can use the left over money on so many other things!
1,Well keep looking and maybe check the local animal shelters if you haven't already.
1,I have an interview tomorrow for a job i had applied. I feel fully prepared for all the questions and I am confident I will do fine
1,i grew up watchim him
1,My friend want's nothing to do with me anymore.
1,For sure! I just don't understand why people have to do that. He wears a wedding ring all the time and we have kids!
1,But you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.
1,No he killed it. Somehow_comma_ I totally went inside and did not watch. We had to because we have two dogs that play in the yard.
1,That is a very good wish to have buddy
1,Oh_comma_ I am so sorry! I am an animal lover_comma_ too. We have two dogs now_comma_ but used to have cats_comma_ too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. It's heart breaking...
1,I am because everyone will probably be younger_comma_ but I am determined to get a degree.
1,For my birthday I wasn't expecting anything since it landed on a Tuesday_comma_ but when I got home my mom had planned a surprise party for me!
1,I am waiting on a fitness machine to come. 
1,I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.
1,I was mad when it was only tuesday!
1,I think i won't be able to able get over him. I feel like already lost my soul
1,I'm having such a great week.  Hows your week going?
1,It did_comma_ but it could have ended very badly for me or even have resulted in me losing my job.
1,It is. But its almost over now lol.
1,People hate on Brady cuz he's been gold since day 1.  But the Eagles came ready on defense that's for sure
1,I have been waiting a few weeks for a bird cage to come_comma_ and it was supposed to come today but it hasnt. :( Bummed.
1,Oh they're in your bubble. that stinks_comma_ some people are weird like that_comma_ no bounderies.
1,Shes 18 months old_comma_ it really is amazing to see them develop. If only people clapped for us when we used the bathroom... ha ha 
1,Oh no_comma_ how big is the dent?
1,I tried finishing my application for online college classes today because I need the financial aid_comma_ and I found out I don't have enough time to complete the requirements.
1,I would hope so. He was a great person. I can still see him putting that watch on in the morning.
1,It was. I would pray each time to God to just let her live a little bit longer. I would put all of my faith in His power to get her through.
1,I get to go to the water park today! I cant wait. 
1,Nope. But I would rather be ready and nothing happen then it come and I am not ready.
1,Thats fair_comma_ so long as you destress and have a good day it doesn't matter what you do right?
1,It doesn't.  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isn't suffering anymore
1,i hope to win the lottery this friday
1,Those sound like much healthier choices. Congratulations! How long did it take to achieve your goal?
1,I bet! It takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that. Kudos to your daughter!
1,A man was chasing after me because I did not give him money.
1,Terrible. So he is making himself unhealthy for a t shirt.
1,Wow - what is the raffle for?
1,Why_comma_ Theres so many beautiful women out there.
1,That's what my friends told me when we moved to Colorado for school. Free couchrides for life.
1,Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?
1,Got into a motorcycle accident and is now paraplegic. They're doing just fine! He's got his pride issues_comma_ but she's sticking with him.
1,That doesnt make sense_comma_ oh well
1,He did_comma_ it really wasn't anyone's fault in this situation. It was late at night_comma_ and snowing quite hard_comma_ so he just didn't see me. Luckily_comma_ I had insurance and I was out of the hospital in a few days.
1,Did you find out who did it?
1,i have all day to try and get everything done _comma_ go to the mall _comma_ have lunch with my friends _comma_ workout _comma_ buy art supplies todays gonna be a good day
1,Oh wow!  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain.  I am so sorry for your loss
1,Oh no_comma_ is there something wrong with your dog?
1,I am sometimes a bad parent
1,You should never lie to them. What did you say?
1,I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. 
1,Well_comma_ they deserve it. Medical school is not easy and they spent unimaginable effort and hard work to finish it
1,He is just a little baseball player now_comma_ But I have high hopes for him
1,Do you like watching movies or reading books?
1,Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out. My stepdad had the first one though.
1,I'm impressed with how well our pool is coming a long_comma_ it should be ready by next summer!
1,Did you have fun when you got to go?
1,Yeah_comma_ and it's not too far away from halloween now
1,ohh that's nice. Legos was one of my favorite games_comma_ when I was a kid
1,Why do you say that?
1,I am so hurt over it.  It was 5 years old.
1,People are always throwing their litter around my apartment complex these days.
1,Yeah - suprising too as he seemed to have his life on track after all his issuues when he was young.
1,I find it hard to be faithful
1,Oh_comma_ that's fun to hear. What kind of class is it? Are you teaching_comma_ or a student_comma_ or what?
1,Tomorrow_comma_ I am having a surgery. I am so afraid of it.
1,Have you ever thought of talking to someone online?
1,Sometimes I miss having coworkers to talk to_comma_ now that I work from home.
1,ooh cool! Did you win?
1,I didn't pay my rent this month because I have some financial problems. The landlord have put a paper on a wall of the building notifying my neighbors that I didn't pay my rent.
1,I studied really hard for a physics test and it was the first time that I ever knew that I did well on a test before.
1,You must be very proud. Cant wait to see what he does next.
1,That would be nice. Maybe he'll go and buy some candy from the candy store.
1,ill try my best and see where it gets me 
1,That's great. Do you get a bonus?
1,The engine was making a horrible sound!
1,Yeah i bet it was a long long drive
1,That's usually what I do.
1,I went to a new pizza place downtown. They have one of those wood fire ovens.
1,I'm going on a rollercoaster tomorrow and I haven't been on one in ages!
1,I hope so_comma_ but my known life is still here
1,I agree.  Has something bad happened to you recently?
1,Awesome. I'm glad that she has things going for her_comma_ and congratulations to you!
1,I was 18. I was so joyful the whole day just played xbox with my brother.
1,Black Ops 4 comes out in October
1,Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here!
1,That sounds frustrating_comma_ especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled.
1,Actually... yeah. You know him?
1,It's a little terrier_comma_ but man can that thing bark! I don't know how my neighbor doesn't hear him.
1,That's great! It's important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities at work to be successful. It's a good example to set for your coworkers too!
1,I know what you mean because I do it too
1,I don't really trust dealerships. What's wrong with your car?
1,Me too. It's been awhile since those accidents happened so it should be fine. I just wanted to be a good friend.
1,Part of my job is to clean up the bathrooms at the end of the night. Usually it's not so bad_comma_ but last night someone stuck so much toilet paper inside of the toilet that it overflowed EVERYWHERE.
1,this is the first in a line of tests that i have to do. i'm dying on the inside a little bit
1,Very true. What would you want to do in the 60's?
1,I'm sure that will help. I have confidence in you.
1,This was back before my first child_comma_ about 12 years ago. I am now a mother of five!
1,Cool.  I have a friend that lives in Brazil
1,Do you have a favorite one?
1,After saving for several month and cutting on spending_comma_ I have now saved enough to buy an iPhone X without any debt or credit
1,I've been consulting the old youtube for sure_comma_ but I think these guys are just rebelling.
1,I need to look it up_comma_ never heard of it.
1,And the snow! I'm excited to start skiing again
1,My friend said she wanted to talk to me. No idea what it could be about.
1,i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee
1,I was on a date at a very fancy restaurant the other night.
1,Yeah I was pretty suprised!
1,when i am out of town away from my wife and son its difficult
1,Just don't get too close! You never know what can trigger them
1,I really miss my family and friends. 
1,Ahhh_comma_ oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!
1,Thanks. I have had a very strict manager before and she seemed a little stiff and reluctant to let me do anything but prep food and not cook. It was frustrating_comma_ just watching but also being paid and feel like i was cheating them.
1,That's very unfortunate. That cashier needs to find a job they actually like doing.
1,Awesome_comma_ my brother-in-law does that.  He loves it.  Hope its beautiful weather for you!
1,oh no! Is everything ok? I hope he didnt scare you
1,I am sure they are_comma_ but it isnt being passed to the lower level workers_comma_ I wish I could afford things like that
1,I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.
1,Oh yeah_comma_ you must be a brilliant student
1,Do you mind talking about it specifically?
1,I was flying back from Boston a couple weeks ago and there was some insane turbulence! I had never been so scared in my life!
1,Yeah_comma_ but I'm glad I'm doing it this way_comma_ since it's kind of grounding me and teaching me the harder things I need to learn about not spending too much. I'm still drowning in student loan debt no matter how hard I try_comma_ though
1,My mom says she will but I think I'm going to transfer after a year. Its too far. 
1,The times we share with family should always be cherished.
1,Hm that's pretty useful info right there...you must be quite the handyman/woman_comma_ I would've probably just bought another one lol
1,Thank you! I am drawn to the stars and sky_comma_ and for some reason it just seemed so fitting. What was the puppy's name?

1,Yeah_comma_ I am. I didn't even know they did across-the-country train rides... Those would be cool. Or maybe they would get boring because you'd start to feel cramped? Who knows. It just always seems like when you hear about trains in movies and TV_comma_ they have this romantic quality about them. Maybe it's because they feel like they're from a different era

1,I did not. I was pretty lazy
1,Yeah that sucks_comma_ I have gone through that too

1,Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work? 
1,sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one.
1,The second one yes. It works but the stretcher pole thing that is metal doesn't work right. Normally I know this company will simply give a partial refund instead of sending me the part that isn't working right so it is frustrating.
1,I may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts. We never delved to the high levels and I see a lot pf value in the teachings.
1,Oh no. That may ruin the walls.
1,yeah im not sure i could every take that job

1,Maybe it will. I'm not sure_comma_ but I feel more happy for him now than I do envious and hurt. So_comma_ whatever happens_comma_ happens. It's okay. 
1,That was very nice of him.

1,Im so sorry_comma_ i can not immagine that
1,I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now?
1,I like action and comedies mostly_comma_ some dramas

1,my kids goldfish died today
1,Maybe it's time to look for another job.

1,Oh yea. I saw it and was quite amazed. Didn't know they can jump that far.
1,unexpected is even better than expected! congrats! 
1,That sucks_comma_ did you ever find him?

1,Yup_comma_ so in 20 or 30 years_comma_ it may not even be accessible to us.
1,I will be meeting my mom again after she went missing for 30 years. Meeting her soon_comma_ and I'm not sure if she still loves me or not.

1,Do you have any siblings?
1,It's a racket. The building is from the 1950s and has hardly been updated. Of course everything is going to look like crap. They just splash the cheapest white paint everywhere. At least there's no carpet in mine that would need to be replaced. Bleh

1,Right. I had no idea their usage stretched such a long time period.

1,My partner is being a big fat jerk.
1,Yes I do hate being all alone. That's how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work.
1,I was. I actually scheduled the first appointment of the day just to make sure that didn't happen!
1,Do you not see them much?
1,I got asked to go on a cruise but_comma_ I'm not sure if I should.
1,Yessir no way to go but up
1,They bring back so many memories.
1,i hope you get the job!
1,Yeah they're great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them
1,Some people get jealous when other people are doing well_comma_ so you are truely a good friend
1,When does it come out?
1,She claims to have had something unexpectdly come up. I think she just forgot. She often spaces out.
1,I find it difficult to be around a crowd.
1,Oh no!  Did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you?  I literally hate car problems.
1,Really? That's amazing_comma_ what words?
1,I bet that is nerve-wracking! I hope you get it.
1,Hi_comma_ I am elated that my dad bought me Porsche Macan. 
1,I was shocked in a good way when my aunt got me a laptop. It was for school
1,I studied so hard for that test and it didnt matter.
1,My employers gave me employee of the month and a nice gift to go along with the award.
1,Pretty sure my pet fish ran away today.
1,That's great!  Having a job is a big deal - and I'm sure it was a blessing after not having one for three years!!  Congrats to you!
1,Oh No_comma_ well glad to see you are here still! 
1,We had roast beef sandwiches for dinner
1,That is awesome. How was the rest of the show?
1,That's awesome. I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..
1,No_comma_ I am well educated. He lowered taxes. 
1,Was is a general eduaction class or one towards your major?
1,"He said ""gruel""! He's going to be a regular Oliver Twist!"
1,That still is impressive. I bet you did feel like you accomplished something
1,I wish my car drove on water
1,Does anything awesome ever end up happening?
1,Wow that's great! She still has to pass the bar though right?
1,That is good. what is going on with it?
1,Oh_comma_ no! It happens to the best of us.
1,well i've been struggling because I gained too much when my wife was pregnant but i lost 10 lbs so far
1,Yes_comma_ I was able to pass. But the wait in between just built up every single day that went by without seeing those results.
1,At first no_comma_ but it did get better
1,I have always been faithful to my girlfriend_comma_ I am proud of that in a way
1,I know how you feel_comma_ you don't have to sell it buddy
1,Always go for the goal!
1,That is just sad. People in education dying really sucks.
1,Well I hope they will find a good way because I don't want it to be similar to Smash 4.
1,Yikes! That must have been terrible
1,Well_comma_ it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off. 
1,I just unearthed hidden treasure_comma_ an entire box of old comics and stuff from my grandparents attic. 
1,Are you upset about this? I'd try meeting hr in person
1,Not me. I'd be walking if i did. 
1,I found some old pictures a few weeks back and they made me think about my childhood.
1,You got that right!  Good job :D   What do you all do these days?  Anything fun?
1,Yes we were both excited_comma_ and the most amazing thing is that we were buying the same shirt in the same store.
1,Oh well that would have been embarrassing_comma_ but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job! 
1,That is really sweet. It sounds like you really love her.
1,I understand that. There are way too many illnesses that are out of our control.
1,MY kid forgot to turn off the oven earlier
1,Happily_comma_ a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry_comma_ they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!
1,I got my results back from my doctor and I am so scared. I think I might have cancer...
1,Your dog is an angel!
1,Lol. That's funny. Good story for when you become her boss.
1,That sucks_comma_ I hope you found your dog.
1,You've got to be careful_comma_ that can cause a very serious accident!
1,Did you get in touch with  the postal office?
1,Thanks I appreciate. It is my manager that is happy
1,Oh_comma_ I am very sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope you feel okay now
1,That is so thoughtful of him_comma_ did you guys catch a ball? 
1,They are 8_comma_ 10_comma_ 12. They are the whole meaning of my existence.
1,I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch and playing it reminded me of my childhood playing games with my friends.
1,Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of?
1,My brother got all A's on his report card. I was blown away.
1,Why certainly! It brought back memories of childhood and how carefree I used to be. I'd love to go back to those times.
1,Amazing. Is that even legal though?
1,Then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you. If you win first prize_comma_ I'm gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so I can buy some!
1,Yea i am proud of him.
1,I looked down and realized I had bitten into a cockroach. I was appalled but finished the food anyway. Guess I got my protein for the day.
1,what...? you were in the toilet? and they were trying to get in? whut? i am so confused_comma_ why would they do that?
1,That's wonderful!  I know how important that can be!  Our family of 4 only has one car so you need it to work!  What happened to yours?
1,I can't wait to go to the cinema this weekend!
1,It's no problem. My work comfort's me just like yours does.
1,I'm tired but otherwise great.
1,I guess so. It is a really nice car.
1,I went to the movies alone. It was quite depressing.
1,Well I hope you can get it fixed soon! Still more hot days to come yet.
1,I am so sorry.  It must make work hard
1,We have relatively the same political views. It's never about that kind of stuff. It's more personal stuff. The next fight will probably be better if she isn't as tired. We'll see.
1,Ugh. Those are the worst.
1,I recently had the chance to betray a friend of mine_comma_ but instead I stayed faithful. 
1,I went to bed at a decent time last night. When I woke up my kids were still up watching cartoons!
1,No_comma_ I have lent my phone out to strangers before_comma_ and have never had someone run off with it. Luckily track and field training paid off and I was able to tackle him down
1,A hike in your package? I'm sorry_comma_ I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you?
1,"Oh yes indeed!  I ordered a 70"" Ultra High Def television and its set to arrive today."
1,i miss robin williams so much
1, I wish I could be with you and not in school
1,That is horrible luck!  At least you weren't hurt.  Some insurance companies cover that as well_comma_ so you should check.
1,That's a real bummer. I am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn't win in the playoffs.
1,I am ready for Connor Mcgregor's UFC fight in October.
1,Whoa! How are you feeling from it now?
1,Generally I am doing pretty well. I was just lazy that time.
1,Seeing an Arcade while on vacation brought back flashbacks to my childhood and how much fun I had there!
1,So I had huge plans to go away for the summer but that has changed. I failed one of my final exams and I now have to take the course over this summer. I cant believe I let that happen.
1,I drank everything in the house_comma_ ate all the food_comma_ passed out_comma_ and woke up to a very upset wife.
1,My social anxiety kicked up the other day while paying for groceries and I failed at doing basic math in my hand due to my nerves. I ended up giving the wrong amount of money.
1,That's pretty neat. Did you buy anything cool?
1,Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?
1,That's okay_comma_ she will forgive you.
1,just think_comma_ today will be tomorrow's memories when looking back
1,Oh my. I would be angry if that happened too.
1,It was about he  though about some new policy.
1,Oh_comma_ now that's exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone?
1,Next month we are finally taking a family vacation. It's been so long_comma_ it seems!
1,its a shame the way some people act towards the U.S
1,Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.
1,I have never done that_comma_ but i most likely need a change soon.
1,That sucks. Are there any cameras in the parking lot?
1,Me too.  There are only a couple of people I don't really like and I never have to see them because they live far away.
1,On top of that_comma_ action figures! Man I didn't know I was such a G.I. Joe head as a kid.
1,That's a good spot then
1,She wanted me to make a date. I told her I would_comma_ but I didn't realize I would be so busy at work and it was getting late.
1,Me too. I am very grateful. Some people are less fortunate
1,All my babies are rescues. My pit mix my fiance bought off the side of the road(wont get into that). My husky_comma_ I got from someone who got her from a breeder that just didnt want her_comma_ and my 2 cats were like living outside and undomesticated. So they all are in a sense. 
1,Yup I'm going to crush it!
1,I lost my key chain. My Late grandma present me for my 10th  birthday
1,It was indeed. I'm happy.
1,Thats awesome_comma_ congratulations for sure
1,Well its best not to think about it too much. Being angry will not help at all. 
1,Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry you're going to miss time with your family. Hopefully they'll take lots of photos!
1,I think you can do it! I mean is there really a limit to the amount of bigmacs one can eat?
1,That is really mean. I am sorry.
1,Neat! Did you buy it used or new? It's always a satisfying experience!
1,I am ready for prom.
1,I am sorry that someone did that to you..
1,they didnt leave a note_comma_ just a dent :(
1,Stressful. Was your work understanding? Is he ok?
1,I am really looking forward to the next Avatar movie. It seems like I have been waiting forever.
1,Ah_comma_ reminiscing can be nice sometimes though. What was the name of the song?
1,A bluejay I believe. No_comma_ it died on impact unfortunately.
1,I'm in education administration. It's not the most exciting thing_comma_ but I enjoy it.
1,I hope you enjoyed every minute of that. It sounds like a once in a life time experience.
1,i try. sometimes i can't help it and i have to and goodness it was awful
1,That wasn't ever nice of her.
1,It was too late. He did know I was mad at him. I could tell he knew he did wrong.
1,"I joined a gym and work out 5 days a week. I also started eating healthy... and I wouldn't say ""huge""@"
1,Definetly! it starts with a single person right
1,I think I'm going to get my girls a 7 for Christmas.  They are at that age that they are no longer into toys and really just want money LOL!
1,I am so ready to go on vacation. I leave next Friday for the beach. 
1,Ah_comma_ you are going to miss him
1,Wow. Well done! How did you do it?

1,I cant wait to leave for vacation next week! I cant stop thinking about it.
1,my job. It might not go well. I missed a lot of work lately.
1,Yes it is hard to coordinate work_comma_ home_comma_ pets_comma_ errands etc everyday. So much to do!
1,I was at an autograph session with Tom Brady and I was getting my picture taken.
1,That is cool. I have never got free tickets to anything.
1,How long have you been married?
1, walked into my office late and in the middle of a important meeting
1,Oh that is terrible! Kids are so mean! What did you do?
1,My neighbors left trash all over the stairs.
1,did you throw him out?
1,I ordered a pizza the other day and it was delicious.
1,The weekends are for the boys!
1,I never really imagined what it would be like to be a parent and then I became one.
1,I am not looking forward to jury duty.
1,Thats awful _comma_ i hate bullying have you told the principle ?
1,I needed shrimp for a recipe and he had some.
1,Oh gosh i worded it incorrectly. They actually won! haha sorry.
1,they removed the movies from the app to prevent you from checking in
1,I'm so humbled by all the gifts we've received for our new baby... totally was not expecting it
1,I'm turning 21 in three days!
1,You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind_comma_ and when you're ready_comma_ adopt a puppy from your local shelter. 
1,Do you know if it is a boy or girl?
1,Your an outstanding mate and great friend_comma_ she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time
1,Today is going to be awesome! We are going to the lake to see all of our family!
1,I hope he learned his lesson. He doesn't remember anything from the night.
1,Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue?
1,Phew! The recent storm narrowly missed my neighborhood!
1,Yes_comma_ everyone does. that was really brave of you!
1,Lol- Some keto things are fantastic! But this...It tastes like a THICK corn flour tortilla. Just really gross! Sad as it cost a pretty penny even on clearance
1,My boss said that I was rude to a customer earlier this year and that is why I am not getting a raise.
1,Not really because our big brother came up to us to just tell us our grandma is dead downstairs.
1,I gambled away a large chunk of money my grandmother left to me when she died. I thought I could put down most of it and double it_comma_ and pay for my college. I thought it was a sure thing_comma_ and now I have none of it
1,Oh no! That stuff is no good_comma_ did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha. 
1,I wish I could go back to the first date my girlfriend and I had
1,My cousin won a athlete meet not long ago. I remember him in his nappies. I should say am very happy
1,Charlotte Russe_comma_ My favorite store! I paired it with black heels and it made me feel glamorous ha
1,I refuse to go back into my neighbor's home. The last time I was there I saw ghosts all over that place.
1,Is your current ceiling fan broken?
1,Potentially_comma_ he seemed a bit deadset_comma_ but we do not know too much all in all
1,It is a poker tournament series.
1,Oh wow. I have never done that
1,We really did. We did a lot of physical activity_comma_ hiking_comma_ and we did have one or two fights_comma_ but I miss that time
1,Oh no_comma_ did something happen to have caused it?
1,I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
1,I am not good with horror movies.  I might have to admit that I am not as tough as I pretend to be I guess.
1,I am amazed that my daughter actually remembered my birthday last month. 
1,I was so happy when my brother was born. Even if there is a huge age gap
1,Yes but sometimes they are also indoors.
1,Its been about a year. We both moved away after college.
1,That's very sweet. My daughters do that too.
1,I was not sure about the dmv. I did not want to go there
1,You're such a naughty person.  What did she do?
1,Some ran away in terror. Others in disgust. I think I sent one to the ER even. At any rate_comma_ I was mortified and I am sure I won't ever live this tragedy down.
1,Nope no one told me. It was so upsetting and I just looked terrible. 
1,That is interesting. Did you have a good time?
1,I'll pray for ya! You need a break before you burn out.
1,I wore my old letter jacket yesterday_comma_ I found it stuffed back in my closet.
1,Am so sorry_comma_  how did you handle it?
1,Yeah_comma_ I should have probably put it in a safer spot. Oh well.
1,Well the freshman dorms are old and small_comma_ whereas the one that I'm living in this year is brand new and closer to an apartment.
1,I want to surprise my mother this weekend for her birthday with a gift.
1,Oh_comma_ man.  That's a terrible feeling. What did you do?
1,Oh man_comma_ that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been?
1,I know right! they keep going up in my area its crazy!
1,I'm impressed you didn't explode!  My wife would've gone insane.  She hates that kind of stuff.  How long did it take to clean up?
1,A guess an A would've been nice then since you worked so hard.
1,That is amazing. What a lovely and caring partner you have. You must be a happy person. Was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift?
1,Kind of fun_comma_ But I let them know I am married and very much love my husband. 
1,I am full of energy as I am starting a new job today.
1,I hate government officials like that
1,That really does not make a lot of sense.
1,i will check it out then!
1,Yes_comma_ a few other small items. 
1,Lol_comma_ that must have been a very proud moment for you as a parent
1,My diet seems to work for me.
1,That sounds really great. Happy for ya.
1," ""I was shocked when I didnt win the lottery!"""
1,Tell me about it.   There are some seriously crappy people out there.
1,Great act of kindness don't go unnoticed.
1,No.. but I have four dogs.. They could have gotten out.
1,Oh wow_comma_ it sounds like you were just really unlucky that night.
1,Do you usually do good in math? It is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me.
1,Yeah just the hustle of having to repeat all the units i failed.
1,My girlfriend dumped me today.
1,I was working out not working.
1,I'm not actually in America so I don't share the same joy as you :p
1,That sounds exciting - where are you going!?
1,Sounds like you're a lot more mature about it.
1,I was in line for a promotion at work and I just found out that I didnt get it
1,Yeah_comma_ you should hide them at least!
1,Oh well_comma_ there is always next time
1,What did he do to inspire such pride
1,Don't you pick out your own clothes?
1,i bet that night was fun!
1,It was amazing sitting on the stage in that hug auditorium.
1,Thank you! I am so excited for all the gifts!
1,You could always throw yourself a party. That way you can invite who you want_comma_ and avoid seeing people you don't want. Haha
1,I am going to tomorrow
1,I used to be really open and honest about my feelings around other people.  Now I keep them to myself and feel a ton better
1,Yay! That is a difficult feat.
1,I ordered a vacuum that I needed asap..however it didn't work when I got it and they wouldn't rush ship another one to me.
1,Are you baking? What did you burn.
1,Sounds like a perfect day.
1,Maybe a quick shot to the beach.
1,Oh I hate people like that.    People that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses' time.
1,It's been 2 years_comma_ so I'm out of the habit of walking_comma_ cleaning_comma_ etc.
1,Ouch_comma_ that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in?

1,Would you believe that doesn't work they still don't listen
1,That sounds wonderful! I bet it was amazing
1,Nice! Did you get the job?
1,I got a larger than expected bill for my cable this month. so I called them to see what was up and I had to wait on hold for 20 minutes.  After that_comma_ the system just hung up on me.  
1,Well_comma_ I definitely didn't have to go anywhere because the next day was Christmas!
1,too much work to leave
1,That is very true. I am seeing how the rest of the week goes or I will simply not be here when they come to fix some stuff around the house.
1,she sounds like a rude person.
1,I am finding it hard to let go of my grandfathers old Mercedes. 
1,Poor little guy. Sounds like he's lucky to have you_comma_ especially at such a critical time in his life.
1,oh yes a gift_comma_ it was. Now she is about to turn 15 and start driving. I can't believe it. 
1,Give it a go. You might be soulmates.
1,I ended up coming in 5th overall_comma_ but only the top 3 were able to represent our country. But its ok_comma_ I knew I had come into the meet in the best shape I could have.
1,I have_comma_ they are not fun
1,That's wonderful. I also love the holidays. It's the perfect time for families.
1,It sure isn't. I can't wait unril they move out!
1,This past month_comma_ due to my consistent exercising i gained 8 pounds of muscle mass with the help of Whey protein powder. I am so proud for my accomplishment
1,Oh geez_comma_ stay safe!  Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me.  They sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening.
1,Sometimes things are much better face to face.
1,I sure am_comma_ it is an awesome feeling_comma_ I hope it is not temporary
1,That's lucky of you_comma_ do you plan on being a pharmacy tech?
1,Well that sounds like it worked out fairly well fortunatley.
1,it really does feel bad tho
1,Its frustrating when I go from 24 an hour to 10 an hour because of his lies. 
1,yeah I know I'll get it_comma_ I'm riding this week! holy crap!
1,Im thinking fast food. Burgers_comma_ fries_comma_ milkshake lol
1,I do not want my vacation to end.
1,What was the secret about?
1,I got an extra 2 days paid time off from work.
1,That takes some real hard work to fix something like that. I am sure it came in handy for cleaning up that stain.
1,A few times before_comma_ but not recently. I do love Fifa the game though.
1,Would you be able to go meet him instead?
1,Maybe too nice. I might never see him again
1,The new school semester starts in a few days and I have all of my supplies ready!
1,I know my friend is going to come through this weekend. I trust his word
1,I'm sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it_comma_ exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle?
1,Went to a funeral of one of my family members two days ago.
1,It is indeed. I wish i could back to my childhood times. No hassle_comma_ no stress of paying bills. Adulthood is really difficult
1,Getting the full-time sounds better taking a one time bonus from him.
1,I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!
1,He will always live on through spirit in your heart. I'm sorry for the loss.
1,Really? It's a nice car to drive.
1,The other day i saw the craziest thing.
1,I would blast them on social media. That is not good_comma_ especially for them not to take responsibility for it.
1,I'm sorry to hear that.
1,I was starving and I needed to eat. But I feel kind of bad about it_comma_ since I am sated now.
1,i had helped him to secure a good job_comma_ and he became rich_comma_ One day he saw me discussing with his fiancee_comma_ he didnt ask question first_comma_ he just came there and slapped me_comma_ we now engaged in a serious fight
1,I received a full ride scholarship to my dream school. I was so happy.
1,Nice! Hes a sweet kid. I bet that brought you joy as well.
1,Wow. My hearty congratulations to you!
1,i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door
1,Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened?
1,of everything_comma_ there is always something to learn
1,Was it a prestigious or expensive vase?
1,I feel at school in front of the whole class.
1,did you pull over or keep pushing through
1,Not at all. I guess I learned my lesson from this dissapointment.
1,Good keep temptations at a distance. You never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night stnad.
1,yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure that's healthy is good!
1,No_comma_ because I didn't want to escalate it further. My parents punished her_comma_ but I felt like she got off lightly. All she got was being grounded for a week and her phone taken away for that same time period. Oh well.
1,I stole from my wife.
1,Going camping next weekend. I haven't hung out with my friends in so long.
1,What was the bad thing about it?
1,They are 18 and almost 16_comma_ they say the days go by so slow but the years fly by - and they are right.  I can't believe they are not that little anymore.
1,I'm not that into sports. What do you like about them?
1,I think so_comma_ too. They've been there for me when I needed it as well.
1,Continuance. For the 5th time. I so tired of it.
1,I would say that I studied well. There was not one day that I took off to do something else other than study.
1,I have been feeling so pleasant and happy lately. Things in my life have just been going perfectly. 
1,Yeah  had to put her down because she was in so much pain. I don't know what to do without her.
1,Oh wow that's horrible. Was the kid ok?
1,I hope so too! I might have to just end up buying it. My hard drive is getting pretty old and running slow.
1,Man I was stoked when I checked the mail yesterday
1,I haven't called and asked yet_comma_ I have a lot of steps I need to complete for successful enrollment. Some of the steps seem to require mailed-in information rather than electronically sent.
1,IT is the worst. My landlord take forever to get things fixed.
1,I am so happy for you.
1,Today I saw the world's biggest cockroach
1,I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry_comma_ but she was fine.
1,That's great. I'm glad you got to feel that feeling.
1,That's not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city. 
1,my wife and I traded all our social media passwords
1,Oh no_comma_ why is that?
1,oh thats sweet. did he like it?
1,Anything from Mario Party to God of War. It's always fun with friends around for commentary lol
1,I call my sister that all the time. 
1,Ok_comma_ buckle up this one's sad. My fiance died when i was 18
1,It's in the fall and yes_comma_ I absolutely will!
1,That is really scary. Did he ever catch up with you?
1,She's just been to her doctor. I'll see if she can see a specialist.
1,You continues a series on Netflix I hope and not the other thing
1,What things we have in common!
1,That's good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust.
1,That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst.
1,I am expecting a settlement i cant wait
1,Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza.
1,My 15 year old cat just passed away. I feel so empty and down in the dumps without him.
1,Wow that's pretty far...do you call/facetime them during the week?
1,You can if you want

1,Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul.
1,He did erect the structure for my new building
1,What is more important than what happened is that you are right in your assessment. She is awesome and I am thankful for her. 
1,I've never even attempted something so huge. You must be very creative and precise. 
1,Its not too expensive_comma_ you should give it a try.
1,sounds like you were pretty well prepared.  howd it go?
1,Hi_comma_ I was cleaning the dishes and lost my wife's wedding ring.
1,ah .. well i guess its not that bad yet

1,Not yet_comma_ I'm afraid I'm going to get audited.
1,I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case
1,That is not good.  Did you scold your cat?
1,There has been this sinkhole in my yard since the hurricane hit last year and it is the cities responsibility to take care of it. I called it in about a week after the hurricane and it is almost a year since then. Yesterday someone came out and marked it with flags and Im certain that means they will begin to work on it soon.
1,I hope you didn't use any.
1,Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit_comma_ but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!
1,Yes it reminds me of a simpler time with no responsibilites.
1,I have been traveling for a month now. I am starting to miss my family and friends.
1,Yay!  I love dogs!  Do you have any you want to get specifically or are you just going to look until you find one that clicks?
1,I am so upset with how my rent continues to increase! 
1,Can you go back and get it ?
1,I am afraid of heights.
1,It was overwhelming_comma_ but we made it without too much stress.
1,Wow_comma_ that must've been really scary!
1,Well once I was asked to check a hefer to see if it was pregnant. And this required some skills I didn't have.
1,I know! I told her I need to approve of all decorations. I am so mad.
1,Nice.  Give the newbie a chance_comma_ I'm sure she'll come around.  What kind of work do you do
1,I really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding. It would really reduce hit and runs.
1,i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my car door
1,I was surprised. She was such a good friend
1,Oh man! I bet you are! Just remember to be confident in yourself and you'll do fine! Don't let trolls to you either

1,Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time!
1,that was very stupid of her _comma_ it seemed kind of racist to me
1,Awwww.  That is so sweet.  It is nice to see when young people are actually being nice to each other!
1,Oh my_comma_ why was she arrested?
1,What are brothers for_comma_ am I right? The absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet payback.
1,I can sue him but it can be a very long process. I am looking to move to another appartment. This is making very mad.
1,Because We do it everyother day and I did not want to seem lazy.
1,I hardly got any sleep last night and it was no fun at all.

1,Does he seem to enjoy being in the water_comma_ or does he resist you a bit?
1,I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.
1,A coworker just knocked all the documents on my desk to the floor. It was an accident but they didnt even bother to help pick them up. Very rude I thought.

1,Yeah. We grow up thinking they're invincible. And then as we get older_comma_ we see that picture deteriorate little by little. And then when they get old and need help_comma_ a lot of the time we don't have time or money to help them_comma_ so it's just stressful and sad all the way around.
1,My son stole some money out of his mom's purse. I was so upset I almost forgot to explain how wrong that was.
1,Ugh. I don't understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing.

1,no_comma_ i don't want to admit it.
1,we did_comma_ it was so much fun_comma_ but super loud

1,My sister just had surgery last week.
1,haha I would have run too!
1,Trust me I've been there! Some days are better than others. Did you apologize?
1,I think my life is going pretty decent compared to the past.
1,Good for you! I'm glad you were able to face it by yourself. Where were you flying?
1,What are you afraid of?
1,I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful?
1,That is infuriating. I know how costly healthcare is. Such a shame that we as a country cant do better.
1,Nothing upsets me more than seeing teenagers on their phones. It really boils my blood.
1,Yes I hate them I have so many side hustles
1,If we can believe and trust in each other_comma_the world will be a better place
1,What were they looking for?
1,Well_comma_ it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree.
1,Yeah I just knew my gas was going to run out before I got there.
1,Are you anxious about it?
1,I hate having to call the cable company. They always make me so mad!
1,When I was young I loved the PBS channel.

1,I spilled coffee all over my brand new laptop yesterday
1,That is so cool you are moving into the job market. Yay!
1,Oh my goodness! Did you get hurt?
1,who would and would not be eliminated was the apprehension of the night
1,We recently got 9 chicks and we've been having to work on making them a coop! I had to do so much research but I think we finally have a place that they'll enjoy living when they aren't able to free range.
1,Well_comma_ remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end.
1,I think I am well prepared so hopefully it should be fine.
1,How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting?
1,That's awesome. Definitely a burden lifted off your shoulders!
1,It was sort of resolved. Everyone still feels a little awkward. Hopefully it will get to that point where it becomes an inside joke and we can all laugh about it.
1,You sound very content. What makes you happy?
1,Yesterday_comma_ my brother committed the unforgivable crime of eating the last twinkie.
1,The little ones always feel so fragile_comma_ what did you do?
1,I have a test tomorrow.
1,That is very nice of your sister!
1,Ohh wow! Those are expensive I bet
1,"She said ""Adolf Hitler"". I was so impressed!"
1,i've watched a lunar eclipse the other day. i didn't expect it to look that awesome

1,That does sound really exciting. 
1,That does sound creepy. What did you do?
1,Wow. I hope you didn't hurt yourself!
1,Well nothing at the first store. I tried on a dress and come out to the mirror and the dress was up in the back. The entire room saw my undies
1,Well they should prbabl shut it down soon. It is only Thursday.
1,Are you serious?  There's a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 10:00p.m.!
1,I am he is such a smart boy
1,Hey i went ot the pound today.
1,Yeah_comma_ my friends are flakey I guess. I hate that
1,someone almost hit me with their car today
1,Yeah_comma_ but now they're looking for him instead of the real crook.
1,I used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother_comma_ she'd tell me all about when my dad was little.  I love old stories like that.
1,I was angry when my ac broke today. It was not good timing
1,Did you move in a better home? 
1,Make sure you give each of them a thank you card
1,Maybe you will win next time!
1,Interesting! I've never hear their music before!
1,yes but it just feels bad to not be able to feel confident in myself and my abilities
1,Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!
1,Okay I see your point_comma_ I think they make really eye catching shoes.
1,I used to love riding my bike around the block
1,I had just moved into my new apartment complex and my neighbor asked to borrow my gate card so I let her. 
1,I'm so mad at my neighbor! He's working on his home and dropped nails in the street.
1,Pretty good! how old is your son?
1,I have to pay out of pocket for school now. Its gonna take forever
1,Why? What did they do?
1,you try calling for a status update?

1,Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?
1,wow_comma_ what makes them happy?
1,Well I guess they might say my blood pressure is too high or something_comma_ I don't know really.
1,That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.
1,Yeah_comma_ I'm glad he kept them because it's always amazing to find it later in life.
1,I was feeling rather anxious the other day because I smoked a ton of pot
1,oh yeah. I am so proud of her. She will be proceeding to compete at the state level
1,I hate it when you have to wait for the results of creating a new bank account. The waiting is killing me!
1,I can't wait for the new Insurgency Sandstorm video game to come out on Steam. It was supposed to come out this summer but no news yet.
1,Just cherish her being little all you can. I wish mine were still little like her. 
1,I think we get another chance in the winter.
1,My supervisor yelled at me in front of all my coworkers! 
1,Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean.
1,I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! 
1,I don't know that he'll appreciate that! Mostly I think I'll look at his childhood pictures for a while and have a good cry.
1,That's awesome! It's always nice to overcome a fear!
1,My cat ran away and had been missing for over a week.
1,I appreciate your kind words_comma_ and I hope everything goes your in the future too.

1,You should - there are loads of recipes online and it tastes so much better than store bought

1,We had a flood in our basement and I lost a bunch of old photos.

1,I came home from vacation to find that my home had been broken into.
1,I am going for a competition tomorrow. I will surely be the winner 
1,Yeah she had to call a taxi because her boyfriend was out of town. 
1,Now that I think of it_comma_ it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her.
1,I was so proud of my oldest son. He finished 6th grade on the A honor roll.
1,Hopefully you will catch those great deals!  Sounds exciting!
1,Some of my coworkers are really slacking off lately.
1,You ever just get those moment where you shake it off and the confident feeling flows in.
1,The note is for what?
1,I made a mistake at work but everyone blamed a coworker. I feel so bad about ir.
1,That's good. I guess you never know what to expect sometimes.
1,I just totaled my car recently. I had it for well over a decade_comma_ it was like a part of me.
1,Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?
1,Nothing like a fresh pair of Air Nikes to make me feel ready to take on the world
1,I'm so glad I have enough money saved in case anything happens.
1,Oh no_comma_ did you ask if they were alright and apologize? 
1,Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.
1,I feel shame for lying to the police.

1,I sometimes feel this way. It's kinda sad.
1,So very!  I wasn't sure he knew what he wanted to do for a while and might take a break but no_comma_ he went right into applying and decided pretty quickly on what he wanted to do in life.  I'm excited for him.
1,I hope so too! Waiting for the call back is so nerver wrecking.
1,Yes_comma_ a lot of people saw.
1,My brother moved to California a few days ago. It was stressful for him_comma_ but he's always been good at thinking things through

1,My daughter graduated over the summer_comma_ and I felt a sense of accomplishment for her. 
1,Do you honk your horn at them?

1,We used to be best friends but when she became president she started excluding me from everything
1,hardly ever. it makes me mad
1,That sounds fun! I like boats_comma_ but I don't think I would be a good rower.
1,My brother snapped my skatebaord
1,Went to put in an order today at the drive thru..and someone stuck their GUM on the speaker...Seriously?

1,Oh wow im the same_comma_ i hope she gets it_comma_ its really stressful
1,I bet it was_comma_ college is such a great time.
1,Thanks lol it wasn't that bad I had the support of my friends.  I'm fully self-employed with my own car_comma_ apartment_comma_ and sustainable income these days. Total 180!

1,It is a remaster of Yellow version!

1,Well that's awfully generous of them. 
1,What are you waiting for?
1,That stinks_comma_ did they give you fair notice so you had chance to find a new place?
1,That sucks_comma_ I love my mom so much I can't imagine her being dead...
1,Yeah that is a bummer. Maybe one day you will live closer together.
1,She would have to come up with a lot of money
1,I just ordered a really nice chair online it should arrive tomorrow_comma_
1,I know it does! My oldest son is starting Junior High..wow
1,Oh man_comma_ that would have freaked me out what did you do?
1,It was a long time ago
1,It means that they just pulled new fresh donuts out of the oven. I prefer to get them with the hot light.
1,Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus. 
1,Eww_comma_ that must have so disgusting. You should report this to the FDA.
1,I just aet a whole pack of cookies
1,That's awesome. You must have trained really hard.
1,That's a nice thought. Your wife I take it?
1,That is awesome!  Does he have any recitals coming up?
1,I was too! What do you think caused it?!
1,That's great. Where did you meet?
1,Is this your first time?  I know that is something that I would even ever consider.  My fear of heights would render me completely lifeless.  So are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places?
1,as a writer i prefer to always be alone
1,Oh no!  Did he give you a reason why?
1,Sometimes you just got to binge on your own_comma_ lol!
1,Yes_comma_ thank God that summer is finally over!

1,Yeah they are fine_comma_ thank you. What's amazing is the tree removal service were on it immediately and got much of the debris up.
1,No_comma_ but I didn't think I would be able to handle the bills by myself. I think I'mg doing pretty good though.
1,My friends threw a party for me when I got promoted at work. I couldn't believe it.
1,I really do not like the new text and drive laws.
1,It wasn't as much scary as it was embarrassing and silly. I was too nervous to get up and leave_comma_ so I just stayed in the wrong class the whole time...
1,Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)
1,Yeah_comma_ I hope so. I have a fear of heights and I'm not much of an outdoors person. But I'm afraid of losing another friend by continuously declining to go out and hang out with them. I'm determined to change that_comma_ since I've lost a bunch of them in the past like that
1,It really sucked since I took this girl on a date and she told me it went really well. Well apparently not since she dumped me after.
1,I was always afraid to go to sleep as a kid.
1,I just knew I was going to get into a school I wanted to. I was just glad I had a chance
1,No_comma_  I don't know who that was and it is better for them it keeps that way_comma_ or I will make them pay for it and denounce them to the police.
1,Well I had to go to the store yesterday but I was all muddy. It made me quite anxious. I didn't have a choice as my power went out and I didn't have much clean.
1,That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you headed to? 
1,Well_comma_ at least you got out
1,I kept him in his little rocker for the most part_comma_ but I picked him up with a soft towel when I needed to.
1,That is the *best* feeling seeing hard work pay off! You much have been so happy for and proud of him!
1,Lately I've been looking forward to what ever new dollar menu item Taco Bell is going to roll out.
1,Are you having desperate times?
1,Wow that is great! When are you going to start?
1,that's wonderful! I go to church every sabbath
1,Well as long as you know the basic concepts and material and have it fresh in your mind for tomorrow_comma_ you should do fine.  I find I always worry and end up doing better than i expected.
1,Canoes and rowboats_comma_ mainly. Things that are somewhat easy to make in terms of time and scale.
1,Thanks_comma_ I like the feeling of going fast on the ice. and i love watching hockey
1,I saw a funnel cloud for the first time as a child. I was beyond scared.
1,I don't blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I don't trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don't deliver :}
1,Yeah_comma_ but I did do better next time_comma_ so I am happy I learned from my mistake. I do occasionally get a bad grade in school. Lol.
1,Well good.  Did you get the job?!
1,Not just working for yourself_comma_ but helping others too. Good on you!
1,I can imagine that would be very painful. Are you doing better now?
1,Thank you. She's the love of my life.
1,I haven't been to the zoo in a long time_comma_ I hope you have fun.
1,I want backpacking in the woods last summer. I had a great time but it was strange not seeing any other person for over a week.
1,He did well. My trust in him paid off and he will apply for his full license soon.
1,My neighbor is out again having a party...I find it strange because he yelled at me on a night before when he was working...but it's okay when he wants too?
1,i agree! I've been married for 5 years and i can't imagine being with anyone else but my wife
1,I had a crazy week with 4 big events and I'm so happy to be at home relaxing in the air conditioning today. My dogs are happy too!
1,That would work too! Or maybe a good meal?
1,I am sorry to hear that then...
1,That is good_comma_ reading always relaxes me too.
1,i was upset when i saw someone had dented my door
1,Oh no! Were you home when it happened?
1,I just found out that my cousin passed away after his battle with colon cancer. He was only 27. I am so upset!
1,I was on a flight and a kid kept kick the back of my chair.
1,Congratulations_comma_ that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace.
1,That must save you some time.
1,i was all alone last night
1,I have already preorder the pay per view and invited all my friends to come over to watch it
1,Of course.  But my best friend just moved to New Zealand
1,Dang_comma_ that's quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it.
1,That would boil my blood. You just gotta smack him upside the head!
1,I am very sad these days.On a deep funk.
1,She cannot take care of her kids_comma_ yet has no problem going out shopping and spending every dime she makes on herself.
1,That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.
1,I couldn't believe my eyes when my favorite aunt pulled up to get me from school.
1,He was special. We've been lucky to have rescued and rehabilitated many animals over the years.  We have two insane cats today.
1,I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!
1,How long has it been since you had your old dog?
1,I hope everything goes well friend.
1,It's at a law firm. I am counting on getting it.
1,I can't wait to see what life brings me_comma_ and where I end up.
1,That sounds like a really good idea to do. 
1,I love horse back riding.  Have you done it before or is this your first time?
1,that sounds amazing! check out the french quarter while you are there.
1,Stir fries are the bomb.
1,Not really. I am more afraid that my washing machine is somehow hiding things.
1,Hey now_comma_ you're an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence? 
1,What kind of game is that
1,i was sad i couldnte eat my favorite dish
1,I feel so bad for having a drunken one night stand.
1,I get pretty bad road rage when my life is threatened.
1,I sure do_comma_ I hope things work out!
1,Tissue is so expensive_comma_ it's unbelievable
1,Movies about vampires terrifies me a lot
1,Sounds a lot like me. I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids.
1,I felt very bad about myself when i forgot my partner birthday this year. She was very disappointed in me for being careless
1,Oh yes_comma_ I've been poor most of my life. It's nice to be able to get something if you need it.
1,I want to shoot for at least a 90-100%.  Can you believe all I needed was a tutor
1,Yes! i cant wait to spoil the lil guy. 
1,I was really hungry yesterday and opened the fridge and happened to have all the ingredients to my favorite sandwich.
1,I hope you have pet insurance_comma_ you never know what can happen.
1,I am not sure. I was so mad at first_comma_ but she doesn't usually do that_comma_ so I let it slide.
1,Holy cow that's amazing!!  Do you think you'll like this new job?
1,A tornado went threw my house!
1,that is no good_comma_ I am sorry that happened to you
1,It is a big house with a pool. I like it.
1,I love star wars. I can't see the next movie that comes out next year!
1,both _comma_ when im with my brother and hes typing on his phone and not looking at the road i start hyper ventilating 
1,Nest season is the last. I was hoping it would last forever like the simpsons.
1,What got in the way of your plans?
1,Why did you break up?
1,It was a really bad experience. Especially since I wasted all the ingredients! 
1,wow i wish i could get my kids to do that. congrats
1,I was staying at a hostel and forgot to lock my backpack. I woke up the next day with money missing.
1,You should talk to her about that.
1,I feel so at ease right now with life_comma_ finally after all the hecticness. 
1,Did they take a lot of things?
1,That's pretty cool. What flavor do you think you are going to get?
1,So annoyed at my friend.
1,It can be infuriating.  For example_comma_ over a 3 year period in my own state_comma_ there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida_comma_ hawaii_comma_ california_comma_ virgin islands)
1,I know! I felt so dumb. We all laughed so hard. 
1,I had a bad experience where my jacket was stolen.  
1,Yes they said they had some issues but still_comma_ I don't want cold food
1,that's too cool I would love to get a puppy some day
1,Yes_comma_ I caught it on video. I plan to let him see it when he gets older.
1,That sounds like good planning to me.
1,Cause we use to go to the games together.
1,Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ?
1,I was watching some old TV shows and it really made me start thinking about my childhood.
1,Well actually I did get another one! So it worked out_comma_ I think for the better actually. 
1,That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should !
1,I know what you mean_comma_ it's the excitement that keeps you up!
1,Well_comma_ she saved our cat from near death by allowing the cat to fall on top ofher when the cat fell off the banister.  Stupid cat.
1,Thats terrible to hear... :( When did you find that out? 
1,I did but it's not doing the trick. I don't want to be laying around the rest of the day but I don't think I have a choice.
1,He had the money for it I guess
1,That sucks. Are you hurt?
1,All of em LOL.. I have been saving up for weeks!  I need back to school clothes
1,That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it.
1,After a long_comma_ hard week at work_comma_ I am headed to the campground this week to disconnect.
1,I do_comma_ but they're kinda living paycheck to paycheck themselves.
1,Sounds fun.  What did you do there?
1,I've been sitting at home bored all week so I wanted to spend some time hanging out with friends tomorrow night. But apparently all of my friends are out of town. So I'll still be stuck home alone!
1,There is a gang selling drugs at the corner of my street. I am afraid to walk around.
1,Well_comma_ that was nice of you. I'm glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didn't go spend it just sitting around or something. I hope that happens more often for you.
1,I know. I was quite surprise. She can also use some books from last year.
1,My heart is broken. My wife has left me.
1,I accidentally smashed it played beyblades.
1,Good. MThat can be devastating.
1,I know what you mean_comma_ I would have been pissed! Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!
1,That's a good idea. There's a lot of preparation that goes into a good trip.
1,My interest rate just went up on my credit card.
1,Ha I was pumped! He loves imitating the dog_comma_ and it's a lot easier for him to do that than me change 8 diapers all day!
1,my kids get on my nerves when it comes to dinner time
1,My daughter slept in too late this morning.
1,my dog got out of the gate and ran away
1,Wow- that's a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?
1,I'm sure if you just relax and focus on being confident_comma_ you will do great! Best of luck!
1,It's good that you thought ahead.
1,Oh wow_comma_ that must be tough. I'd like to think they were having trouble dealing with it themselves and that's why they didn't tell you right away.

0,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? "
1,Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 
0,"Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . "

0,Then I'll have vanilla ice cream . 
0,Fine . I will bring it right away . 
0,"Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ? "

0,"Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . "
0,How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
0,"Yeah , are they easy to look after ? "
0,"Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . "

0,"Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? "

0,Let's go out for brunch .

1,"Sure , that ' d be great . Where would you like to go ? "
0,"Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ? "
0,"Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . "
0,"They are both spicy hot , I've heard . "
0,"That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . "
0,They might be too hot for me . 
0,Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them . 
0,What about any special Beijing dishes ? 
0,There's the Beijing roast duck . 
0,"Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ? "

0,"Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? "
1,Pretty well . What about you ? 
0,Fine . Where are the other guys ? 
0,It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . 
0,Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? 
0,"Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? "
0,"Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . "
0,Did you go to a real estate agent ? 
0,"No , that will be too expensive . "
0,"That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? "
0,My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . 
1,Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .

0,We usually go to the cafeteria . 
0,"Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now . "
0,What are you doing there on the computer ? 
1,"Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends . "
0,That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . 
0,"Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ? "
1,"Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . "
0,No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days . 
0,There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?

0,I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course . 
0,Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? 
0,Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . 
0,Let's look at our menus .

1,"Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . "
0,"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ' t you ? "
0,"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? "
0,"Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . "
0,And must I go back to school ? 
0,"No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . "
0,"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 ."
0,You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
0,What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 
0,Who knows ! That might come to later . 
0,"My name is Wang Liang , I ' m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? "
0,I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . 
1,"You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . "
1,Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? 
0,"Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone ."

0,"Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . "
0,I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 
0,I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
0,Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
0,"No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . "
0,I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room . 
0,Let me see a doctor . 
0,"I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time . We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 ."
0,I thought this was the emergency room . 
0,"It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait . You aren't bleeding , are you ? "
0,No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
0,"Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? "
0,Can you fill out this form then ? 
0,"No , I can't . I'm left-handed . "
0,That's very inconvenient for you then . You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . 
0,Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
0,"Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done . Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? "
0,No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
0,"Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? "

1,That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
0,No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .

1,"Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . "
0,"I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? "
0,"Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . "
0,How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?

0,"I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . "
0,I am sure that document was filed . 
0,"Well , let me check again under a different heading . "
0,Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . 
0,Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .

0,It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . 
0,"I really don't care , just go to sleep . "
0,"What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ? "

0,Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
0,Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ' m really looking to settle down . 
0,"I see . okay , well let ' s move on to discuss your education shall we ? "

0,they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
0,that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
0,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! "
0,"regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . "
0,"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . "
0,I need to use the ATM . 
0,I ' m not sure how . 
0,I ' Ve never used one before .

1,We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 
0,"Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . "
1,You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
1,Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
1,"Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . "

0,I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . 
1,Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . 
0,True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? 
0,"Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . "
0,I guess it is a little pricy . 
0,Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. 
0,"That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . "
0,"That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . "
0,Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
0,"You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . "
0,Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . 
0,Do you have a particular style in mind ? 
0,"The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . "
0,I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . 
0,I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . 
0,The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? 
1,Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 
1,"Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . "
0,Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .

0,"I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . "
0,"Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there ! "
0,"Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . "
0,I have never been to the personnel market . 
1,Really ? I have been there several times . 
0,Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . 
0,"So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ? "
0,"Yes , there are many famous corporations . "
0,When will there be a job fair ? 
0,Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
0,How about going there to have a look now ? 
0,Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? 
0,"Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . "
0,Can you make it any cheaper ? 
0,I'll take it if you give me a discount . 
0,$ 10 . That's the best I can do .
1,OK . I'll take the blue one . 
0,"Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? "
0,"Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . "
0,Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
0,"We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . "

1,Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . 
0,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
0,We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
0,"I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . "
0,We need to find a good realtor . 
0,"Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . "
0,"Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . "
0,But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
0,"Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . "
0,"I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has "
0,"Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own . And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . "
0,So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
0,It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
0,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
0,"Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . "
0,"Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . "
0,Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
0,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
0,I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 
0,Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . 
0,I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening . My wife is terribly ill .

0,"I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . "
0,"Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help . "
0,You ' re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ? 
0,I ' m actually travelling around Asia . 
0,"Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ? "
0,"Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me . "
1,Thank you very much . That ' s very kind . 
0,"Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? "
0,"Sure , but I have to finish this report first . "
0,Never mind . I'll do it . 
0,Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
0,"Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you "
0,"I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . "
0,How did you spend the night there ? 
0,"We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . "
0,"I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . "
0,"Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? "
0,Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . 
0,I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?

0,She's very fond of detective stories ? 
0,I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
0,Do you know if she's read this one ? 
0,"I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! "
0,Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
0,I suggest you take this book . It ' s very exciting . 
1,Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ?

0,"Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . "
0,Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
0,"I know , I know . But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! "
0,Really ? What's the series about ? 
0,"Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . "
0,"It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . "
0,"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . "

1,That's very kind of you . Thank you . 
0,"We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again . "
0,I need to buy some flowers for my wife . 
0,Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses . 
0,What would the roses cost me ? 
0,They're only $ 20 a dozen .
1,I like the sound of that . 
0,"Yes , that is today's sale price . "
0,A dozen will be fine . 
0,Is there anything else you'd like to get ? 
1,These roses should make your wife very happy . 
0,"Room service , is there anything I can do for you ? "

0,What kind of food do you usually eat ? 
0,"I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken . "
0,Is that really all that you eat ? 
0,How do you stick to only those foods ? 
0,"Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you . "
0,"Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ? "
0,"I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat . "
1,That does sound pretty good . 
0,"I know it does , and that's because it is . "

0,Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ? 
1,"Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . "
1,Thanks . How much would that come to ?

0,You have to make an appointment first . 
1,"Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ? "
0,Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
0,"Yes , I will schedule you for that time . "
1,Thank you very much . See you then . 
0,Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you ' re interested in . 
0,Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
0,"Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . "

1,"yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! "
0,let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 
0,"what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? "
0,I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . 
0,"well , let's get a plate of those then . "
0,sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 
0,I think I might have a dahl . 
0,it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 
1,that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 
0,ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 
1,that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 
0,I think I'll have a beer . 
0,"ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? "
0,I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 
1,you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! 
0,what would you do without me ? 
0,"This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . "
0,pompous . How may I help you ? 
0,"Yes , I'd like to reserve a table for dinner . "

0,"It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper . "
0,"Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada . "
1,"Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here . "
0,Can you help me now ? 
0,"No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . "
0,Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ? 
0,"I did , but he wasn't able to either . "
0,Have you got any experience in advertising ? 
0,"Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ' s something urgent . "
0,Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? 
0,"Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . "
0,Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 
0,"Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . "
0,Have you had any experience with computer ? 
0,"Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . "
0,That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? 
0,I can handle them without any trouble 
0,What have you learned from jobs you have held ? 
0,"Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . "
0,Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days . 
0,I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ? 
1,"How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? "
1,"It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . "
0,What are you going to do now ? 
0,"I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . "
0,That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? 
0,"Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . "
0,"Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . "
1,"I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . "
0,Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
0,I've never gotten one . Have you ? 
0,I got a ticket yesterday . 
1,Really ? What did you get one for ? 
0,I parked in the red zone . 
0,Why did you do that ? 
0,I needed to get something really quick . 
0,Where did you park at ? 
0,Don't you have your own parking spot ? 
0,I needed to be fast . 
0,That was very lazy of you . 
0,How may I help you ? 
0,I ' m having a problem . 
0,What problem are you having ? 
0,There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make . 
0,Do you have the statement for your card ? 
0,What are the charges you ' re referring to ? 
0,The last four charges on the page . 
0,I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges . 
0,How long will an investigation take ? 
0,"I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges . "
0,Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? 
0,I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? 
0,"Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . "
0,"Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB ."
0,"OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? "
0,"Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? "
0,"No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . "
1,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
1,"I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !"
1,Well you can ' t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ' m the banker . 
0,Can I have my $ 200 please ?
1,"Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice ."
0,"Hi , is this Professor Clark ' s office ? "
0,This is Professor Clark speaking . 
0,"Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . "
0,"Yes , what can I do for you ? "
1,I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ' t be able to come to school today . 
1,My goodness ! Are you OK ? 
0,"I broke my leg , but it is healing . "
0,How long will you be out of class ? 
0,I should be able to return by next Monday . 
0,"Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . "
0,Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? 
0,"Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ' m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ' s water leaking everywhere ! "
0,"I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ' s why it won ' t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ' s not working either . I suspect that there ' s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ' s what ' s making your toilet overflow . "
0,"Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . "
0,"Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ' s urgent . "
1,That would be great ! Is it expensive ? 
0,Let ' s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . 
0,"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . "
1,I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
0,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
1,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
0,"Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . "
0,"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights . "
0,I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
0,"I don't want to do that to you , Karen . "
0,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
0,"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely ."
0,"I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . "
0,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
1,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
0,I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 
1,Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
0,Good evening . What'll you have ? 
0,I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ? 
0,Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ? 
0,Could I have some fruit ? 
1,"Of course . Wait for a moment , please . "
0,"Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? "
0,"Fine , thank you , and how are you ? "
1,"Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . "
1,"Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . "
0,How are you getting along with your business ? 
0,"Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . "
0,"I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . "
0,"By the way miss , where is the toilet ? "
1,"Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . "
1,"What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . "
0,"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ' m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? "
0,"you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . "
0,that ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ? 
0,"it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait ."
0,can I buy stamps here ? 
0,sure . How many would you like ? 
0,I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
0,are you sending them abroad ? 
0,twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
0,"do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . "
0,"ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence ."
1,thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful . 
1,"Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? "
0,Are you good at cooking ? 
0,"I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! "
0,It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! 
0,I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? 
0,"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . "
0,That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . 
0,I have the same idea as yours . 
0,It's OK . Please have a taste of it . 
1,"Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . "
1,Thank you for your praise . 
0,"Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? "
0,"I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . "
0,"So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? "
0,Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . 
0,Room service . What can I do for you ? 
1,This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .
0,"Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one . Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ? "
0,"Yes , I ordered the express service . "
0,"Sir , we are terribly sorry for that . We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?"
0,I'd like you to do me a favor . 
0,Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office . 
1,Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . 
0,"Excuse me , may I help you ? "
0,Would you please fill some gas for me ? 
0,Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ? 
0,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . 
0,It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
0,What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
0,All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . 
0,A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . 
0,Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . 
0,I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . 
0,"There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? "
0,I haven't seen her yet . 
0,I think that she is very pretty . 
0,Tell me how she looks . 
0,She's probably about five feet . 
0,"That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . "
0,The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . 
0,I think I might've bumped into her before . 
0,Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? 
0,"Take a seat inside and see what you think . So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? "
0,"Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary . "
1,"You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal ."
0,Can I return the car in San Francisco ? 
0,"San Francisco ? No , sir . We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . "
1,Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . 
0,"No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . "
0,"Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that . "
0,"Do you still want the car , sir ? "
1,Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it . 
0,"Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . "
0,Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon . 
1,Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it . 
0,Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . 
0,"Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . "
0,Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . 
0,True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head . 
0,You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps . 
0,You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven . 
0,Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . 
0,Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first . 
0,OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant 
0,Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? 
0,Where do you want to go ? 
0,I'm going to the hospital . 
0,Get in . I'll take you . 
0,About how much will it cost ? 
0,It will cost you $ 10 .
0,"By the way , what's the time ? "
0,"You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know . "
0,It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
0,You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . 
0,It was made in Jingdezhen . 
0,Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? 
1,This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . 
0,It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . 
1,It must be most precious . 
0,But it is really worth the price . 
0,"Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? "
0,"Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . "
0,"Oh , Would you do me a favor ? "
0,Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . 
0,Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? 
0,"Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . "
0,"Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . "
0,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? "
1,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
0,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . "
1,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
0,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . "
0,"Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? "
1,To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
0,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? "
0,"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . "
0,Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 
0,"Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . "
0,It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 
0,Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . 
0,What about the performance itself ? 
0,"Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . "
0,"Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . "
0,It surely is . And the cast is really the best . 
1,Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 
0,"The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back ."
0,All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? 
0,"Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 ."
0,"I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00"
0,That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
0,"Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . "
0,What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
0,"Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ? "
0,We still prefer French dressing . 
0,Could I have some fish ? 
1,Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? 
0,"Fine , And what about something to drink ? "
0,Would you like to have some more beer ? 
1,"No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . "
0,Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . 
0,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? "
0,"Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . "
0,"So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . "
0,I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . 
0,"That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes ."
0,It ' s always easier to say something than to do it . 
0,"It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . "
0,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . 
0,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . "
0,It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . 
0,"You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . "
0,I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . 
0,You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .

0,"Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . "
0,Are you going to buy a bicycle ?

1,I'm afraid you can ' t . You ' re welcome to pay in cash . 
0,Do you have a free moment ? 
0,Sure . What do you need ? 
0,I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
0,"Well , first you have to turn this switch on . "
0,"Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? "
0,Just a second . I'll go get some .

0,Where do I put the change ? 
0,"The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . "
0,Is that everything that I have to do ? 
1,I appreciate you helping me with this . 
0,"If you need anything else , just let me know . "
0,Do you have any questions ? 
0,"Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? "
0,"Yes , after you ' Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation "

1,It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different . 
0,Where did you want to go for lunch ? 
0,I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . 
0,I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria . 
1,I actually like the food there . 
0,Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? 
0,They have anything you want .

0,We can eat at the cafeteria . 
1,I think you'll really like the food there . 
0,"Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . "
0,The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . 
0,"Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared ."
0,"Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . "
0,"First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . "
0,"For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . "
0,I want to buy a black suit .

1,"How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . "
0,"Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . "
0,"Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . "
0,"I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . "
0,"That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 ."
0,"That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount ."
0,"I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?"
0,"Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?"
0,All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .
0,I'm not sure . You look familiar . 
0,"Yes.And you're Mr . Jones , I remember . "
0,That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company .

0,Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? 
0,"If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . "
0,"But if I don't pass , will you call me ? "
0,"I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . "
0,Then do I have the chance to get this job ? 
0,"I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . "
0,"I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . "

0,I think Yoga might be suitable for me . 
0,Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . 
0,But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . 
0,I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .

0,Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 
0,"It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . "
0,"Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . "

0,There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? 
0,"I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . "
0,"We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . "

0,"Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content ."
0,Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? 
0,Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .

0,Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . 
0,"Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . "

0,"I ' m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ' t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! "
0,"No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ' s hear more about these chocolates you ' re offering . "
0,"Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ' re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately .

0,"Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . "
0,Really ? I didn ' t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production

0,"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ' m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . "

1,"Ah , get back to you . "
0,Do you need a guide ? 
0,"Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ? "

0,"Lucy , I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? "
0,"Monica , wait a moment . I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it . "
0,I think I can handle it by myself . 
0,I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
0,"I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . "
0,Other company rules also need your attention . 
0,"Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . Yeah , thank you for telling me . "

0,"Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . "
0,I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
0,"I'm ready when you are , sir . "
0,"Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . "

0,I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ? 
0,"Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit ."
0,A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ? 
0,"I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely . "

0,"Yeah , you ' re right . We aren ' t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . "
0,"Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ' s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . "
1,"Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . "
0,"Well , we don ' t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . "
0,I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 
0,Not in a million years !

0,"You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . "
0,"The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . "
0,Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? 
0,It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . 
0,"It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . "
0,"Billy , you are late again . "
0,I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
0,Yes he ' s in his office .

0,"Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? "
0,You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
0,It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
0,"Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? "
1,Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
1,That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . 
0,Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
0,Why not ? it's so cool . 
0,But it will pose a risk to your health . 
0,"I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . "
0,"Well , I didn't realize that . "
0,"I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . "
0,"Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . "
0,"Hello , this is room 1205 . Our message lamp is flashing ."
0,"Hold on a minute , please . "
0,I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you . 
0,Would you bring the message to my room . 
0,I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment . 
0,Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately . 
0,"OK , we wait for you . "
1,guess what ? I've got great news ! 
0,"well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? "
0,"well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . "
1,really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? 
1,she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . 
1,wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? 
0,"it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . "
0,are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? 
0,"yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! "
0,do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? 
0,"I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . "
1,I'm really looking forward to reading your column . 
1,"me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? "
0,"sure , where would you like to go ? "
0,perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . 
0,have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? 
0,I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . 
0,"you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . "
0,"it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ? "
0,"yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ? "
0,"sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . "
0,"that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? "
0,no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . 
0,how much does the magadize cost ? 
0,"it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . "
0,that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? 
0,"Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . "
0,"I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! "
1,Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain ! 
0,Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . 
0,But you could have saved money . 
1,"From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought ! "
0,"F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... "
1,Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! 
0,Can you help me do an internet search ? 
0,Sure . What do you want to find ?

0,"Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library . "
0,I just have to come up for air . I ' Ve been here for too long a time . 
0,OK . You ' d better come back in two hours . 
0,Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . 
0,I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . 
0,Do you know when he will be back ? 
0,He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . 
0,Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? 
0,The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . 
0,"Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? "

0,You're just a little run-down from overwork . 
0,What am I supposed to do ? 
0,I think all you need is just a vacation . 
0,Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest . 
0,"Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say . "
0,"Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ? "
0,"Morning , Michael . I ' Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ' Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . "
0,"Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown . Coffee ? "
0,"No , thanks . I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . "

0,"Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . "
1,That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?

0,I was so scared when I saw the gun . 
0,He took the money and tried to get away . 
0,Did the cops show up in time ? 
0,He didn't even make it out the door . 
0,hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? 
0,"hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ' m shocked that the pole "
0,people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
0,you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
0,there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ' t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
0,"well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? "
0,yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
0,"well , they ' Ve got the money and she ' s going tomorrow for treatment . "

0,Why don't you wear a scarf ? 
0,What can wearing one do for me ?

0,I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ? 
0,"Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi . "
0,How much will that run me ? 
0,"It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable . "
0,Do the drivers speak English ? 
0,"Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem . "
0,"For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . "

0,"Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ? "
0,What What features do they offer ? 
0,"Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars ."
0,"I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . "
0,"Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . "
0,"No , that won ' t be necessary . "
0,"In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? "
0,"Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars . "
0,"Would you check the engine , please ? It is knocking . "

1,"Oh , don ' t worry , I will ! "
0,It ' s nice meeting you . 
0,"It ' s nice to meet you , too . "
0,I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate . 
0,Would you like to ask me anything ? 
0,What do you feel about gay marriage ? 
0,I think everyone has the right to love who they want . 
0,Would you legalize gay marriage ? 
0,Many people won ' t like that . 
0,"I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage . "
0,"Hello ? This is John Smith.Can I speak to Mr . White , please ? "
0,This is Mr . White speaking . 
0,"Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ? "
0,I ' d like to know more about it . 
0,Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
0,OK . I will be there . 
1,Thank you for calling . Goodbye . 
0,Please fill in the arrival card and sign the register . 
0,All right . Which room shall I have ?

0,"Marketing manage office , can I help you ? "
0,What time you suspect back them ? 
0,"Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? "
0,"No , thanks . I'll call back later . "
0,That's fine.please call again later . 
0,"So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... "
0,"No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . "
0,How many people are on the board of directors ? 
0,"Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line ."
0,"How much will my pay be , if you don ' t mind my asking ? "
0,"We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ' t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?"
0,"Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ? "
0,No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . 
0,"Mum , can I finish my homework later ? "
0,Sorry . You know the rules . 
0,But I want to watch TV now . 
0,That ' s out of the question . 
0,Not even for an hour ? 
0,"She ' s in the garden , Jane . "
0,She ' s sitting under the tree . 
0,"Is Tim in the garden , too ? "
0,"Yes , he is . He ' s climbing the tree . "
1,I beg your pardon ? Who ' s climbing the tree . 
0,"The dog ' s in the garden , too . It ' s running across the grass . It ' s running after a cat . "
0,I have a sore throat and headache . 
0,"Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . "
0,I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . 
0,Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
0,Leo ! I wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget . We ' re having a get-together after work tonight at Carl ' s Karaoke Club to celebrate having finished it . We ' d love to see 
0,"What fun ! Normally I ' d love to , but I ' m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ' Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King . "
0,"Oh , right . You ' re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ? "
0,"Unfortunately , I just can ' t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ' s my second wedding anniversary , and we ' re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . "
0,Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ? 
1,"Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! "
0,Excuse me . Do you mind if I try this on ? 
1,Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way . 
1,Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ? 
0,"Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? "
0,"Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color . "
0,Well . It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though . 
0,Are you going to vote ? 
0,"I plan to , but what day is the election ? "
0,Can you just tell me ? 
0,The election is this Tuesday . 
0,It ' s a good thing I asked you . 
0,That should ' Ve been something you knew already . 
0,Whatever . Just make sure you go vote . 
0,"Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . "
0,"Zina , why are you whispering ? "
0,I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . 
1,What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ? 
0,Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince . 
0,"We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . "
0,"OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . "
0,You get your bus pass ? 
0,I'm not going to buy one . 
0,I think it's a waste of money . 
0,It actually costs less if you have a bus pass . 
0,You can use it however many times you need to . 
0,"Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . "
0,You should go get yours . 
0,"Yeah , I think I will . "
0,Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ? 
0,"Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ? "
0,"I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ? "
0,"Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I . "
0,Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ? 
0,"Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ? "
0,"It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 ."
0,"Yes , that's right . Extension 162 ."
0,"Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message ."
0,"It's quit a big cafeteria , isn't it ? "
1,Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety . 
1,Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it . 
0,I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ? 
1,I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? 
0,"I don ' t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ' t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . "
0,You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
0,So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
0,"Italian , Indian and chinese . I ' Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . "
0,Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
0,"Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . "
0,How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
0,"Obviously , it depends on what I ' m cooking . But I ' d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . "
0,I'm searching for an old music box . 
1,You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
0,"If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice ."
0,"We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . "
0,Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
0,"Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . "
1,"Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . "
0,"That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? "
0,"Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . "" "
0,I guess I was asking for too much . 
0,"If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . "
1,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
0,Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! 
0,Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
0,"I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! "
0,"What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . "
0,Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
0,"We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . "
0,Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !

1,That's wonderful ! I like swimming . 
0,"John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . "
0,"I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . "
1,"Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . "
1,"After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . "
1,Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . 
1,"You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! "
0,Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? 
0,Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
0,I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . 
0,"If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? "
0,"Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection . They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . "
0,What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . 
1,I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .

1,What ? He can't do this to you . 
1,"Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . "
1,I shouted it back of course . 
0,"Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? "
0,What would you do if you were in my shoes ? 
0,"Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . "
1,"No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . "
0,"I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . "
1,I am too angry to do that . 
0,"Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . "
1,Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
0,Will you have it later ?

0,I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . 
0,"I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . "

0,I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? 
0,"I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money . "
0,"Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . "
0,"I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? "
0,"Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . "
0,I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours . 
0,Can you give me more details on what is included in the package ?

1,I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . 
0,Any idea when he might be back ? 
0,"Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . "

0,"You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ' t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . "
0,Sure that ' s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? 
1,"Hey , honey I ' m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! "
1,Great ! Can you set the table ? 
0,Just a sec I ' m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast 
0,Wait ! Don ' t turn it on ... 
0,"Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? "
0,I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . 
0,This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .
0,"What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? "
0,"Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . "
0,"I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... "
0,Is this a duty-free shop ? 
0,"Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? "

0,That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . 
0,Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? 
1,"Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . "

0,Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off . 
0,What do you think about this store ? I heard it ' s a posh store that ' s only got branches in big cities . 
0,I love this store . The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive . 
0,Don ' t worry . I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress . 
1,Really ? I thought you hated shopping ? 
0,"I do , that ' s why you should appreciate this gift ! "
0,Sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on . 
0,How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .

0,"Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . "
0,What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? 
0,"Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ? "
0,Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job . 
0,What are your salary expectations ? 
0,I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . 
0,"The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence ."
0,I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ?

0,That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . 
0,Do you have any product that controls frizz ? 
0,"With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . "
1,"And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . "
0,"Would you pour me some of that tea , please ? "
0,"Hey , look , there is a circus show over there . "

0,"I really wanted you to come , but I understand . "
0,I'll hold you to that . 
0,I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? 
0,It's simple . You can use call transfer . 
0,"Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . "
0,"Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . "
0,"In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . "
0,Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . 
0,Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ? 
0,Then I'll see you in the afternoon .

1,That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 
0,Just a minute ... go to this one . I ' ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
0,What do you use your computer for ? 
0,"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ' t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you "
1,"Computers are great , aren ' t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them . "

0,"I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem . "
0,"No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ? "

0,"Not long , because people rush for lunch . "
0,The line sure does move fast .

0,"It really does , I can't wait . "
0,What time does the party start ? 
0,It starts at 8 o'clock .

0,"I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . "
0,"Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . "

0,I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . 
0,"Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . "
0,"Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? "
1,It was good . I brought lunch from home today . 
1,You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . 
0,"Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . "
0,"I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . "
0,"Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ? "
0,You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
0,"Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . "
0,"Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . "

0,That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . 
0,I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . 
0,"It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! "
0,Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? 
0,Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .

0,I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? 
0,I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . 
0,Do you have an account with this bank ? 
0,In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . 
0,What is the interest rate on your card ? 
0,The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
0,Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . 
0,How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? 
0,You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . 
0,Does the card provide any other benefits ?

0,"In the same way , probably . "
0,Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? 
0,"Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . "
0,But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? 
0,"Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . "
0,"It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? "
0,"Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . "
0,Why not come over to work in my company ? 
0,I need to think it over . 
0,Tell me what you need . 
0,"All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . "
0,We are approaching the top of the mountain . 
1,What a beautiful view we have here . 
0,"Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city . "
1,Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? 
0,Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . 
0,what did you do last night ? 
0,I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
0,did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? 
0,"yes , it was a very evenly matched game . "
0,what were the results of the game ? 
0,it ended in a tie . 
0,what was the actual score ? 
0,really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . 
0,"if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . "
0,"their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . "
0,how many more games are left this season ? 
0,that was the last game before the playoffs . 
0,when do the playoffs start ? 
0,in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
1,of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
1,"Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . "
1,"sure , that would be great . "
1,"Ok , it's a date then ! "
0,"I ' m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ' s hard to keep track of everything around here . "
0,"That ' s for sure . You ' re new , too , huh ? "
0,Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
0,"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . "
0,"Gave me the receipt , please . "
0,It's too small for me to wear . 
0,Would you like another bigger one ? 
0,No thanks . I want to have a refund . 
0,"OK , here is your money . "
1,"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . "
0,"What is your favorite color , miss ? "
1,Here you are . It ' s very attractive . 
0,May I try it on ? 
0,Is there a mirror around here ? 
0,"Yes , you look very nice . "
0,We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
0,What can I help you with ? 
0,May I ask you something ? 
0,How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? 
0,What do you need to take it for ? 
0,I'm trying to get my license . 
0,Can I do all six hours in one day ? 
0,You have to do it in three days . 
0,That's all I have to do ? 
0,"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . "
0,Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . 
0,"An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . "
0,"Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? "
0,I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . 
0,"Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? "
0,"Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . "
0,It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? 
0,"Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . "
0,"Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . "
0,I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . 
0,"Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . "
0,Here you are . You left the medicine here . 
0,Sorry . I was too worried . 
0,I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . 
0,"Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? "
0,"Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . "
0,I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . 
0,It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . 
0,What kind of place shall we rent ? 
0,"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . "
0,Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
0,"Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? "
0,"I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . "
0,"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . "
0,"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . "
0,How much do you think the rent will be ? 
0,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
0,I have a terrible toothache . 
0,"Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity . "
0,I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . 
0,Then I might as well have it done now . 
0,"you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . "
0,"May I have a look at that vase , please ? "
1,Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
0,"Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . "
1,Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? 
0,Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? 
0,The local newspaper has ads for housing . 
0,Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? 
0,Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . 
0,What do landlords charge for rent ? 
0,"Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? "
0,"There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . "
0,You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . 
0,I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . 
1,"Sure , I ' ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . "
0,"Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ? "
0,I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . 
0,The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . 
0,"Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . "
0,Why is the price so high ? 
0,"It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . "
0,Model of computers aren't compatible ? 
0,Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . 
0,"Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . "
0,"But by then , the technology will be outdated . "
0,"True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . "
0,"That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . "
0,"This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . "
0,I guess you get what you pay for . 
0,What kind of permanent would you like to have ? 
0,what kinds do you have ? 
0,"Oh , yeah , It ' s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form . "
0,"Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please . "
0,Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? 
0,"I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . "
0,"I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . "
0,"Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . "
0,"No , no . I've got plenty left . "
0,Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? 
0,What am I going to do about souvenirs ? 
1,"Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! "
0,"Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . "
0,"Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . "
0,Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . 
0,"I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . "
0,Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
0,"Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes ."
0,That doesn't sound too bad . 
0,"Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo ."
1,Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 
0,"I'd like to order breakfast , please . "
0,Two muffins and a cup of coffee . Will it take long ? 
0,"No , just a few minutes . "
0,How may I help you ? 
0,Could you cancel a check for me ? 
0,I wrote the check out for way too much . 
0,I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
0,What were you supposed to write it out for ? 
0,I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
0,I ' ll just cancel it for you right now . 
1,That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver . 
0,"Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? "
0,Would you care for a drink before you order ? 
0,A glass of Qingdao beer . 
0,"Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? "
0,Will you make some recommendation ? 
0,"I ' m taking BA fright 123 to London . Can you tell me where the reporting desk is , please ?"
0,"Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there . "
0,Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
0,"Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ? "
0,"The suitcase , that ' s all . Except my handbag . Of course . "
0,Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ' t weigh your handbag . 
0,Yes . I ' ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket . 
0,What must I do next ? 
0,You must go to immigration to the departure lounge . 
0,"But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? "
0,"It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . "
0,I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . 
0,Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . 
0,"Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . "
0,"You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? "
0,"Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . "
1,An excellent idea . Work now and play later . 
0,"I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . "
0,"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? "
0,"Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? "
0,"Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . "
0,I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . 
0,"Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? "
1,"Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? "
0,That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? 
0,"Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . "
1,"I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . "
0,"I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . "
0,"Well , it's all new stock in the window now . "
0,"May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? "
0,"Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . "
0,"Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . "
0,"Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . "
1,"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . "
0,"That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for . "
1,"There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . "
0,I've come to hear about your offer . 
0,"We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days ."
0,I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . 
0,You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . 
0,I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . 
0,"But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . "
0,I agree that yours are of the top . 
0,"Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? "
0,"To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help ."
0,Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
0,Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
0,So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . 
0,"Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese . Hotels often have no fourth floor . "
0,"I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask . How much should I tip this guy ? "
0,"People don't usually tip here , but you can . Fifty dollars should be more enough . "

0,I ' d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .
0,Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ? 
0,I ' d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return . 
0,"Economy , please . How much is it ? "
0,Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ' m always afraid of losing my tickets . 
0,No problem . How do you wish to pay for it ? 
0,Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
0,Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ? 
0,"An aisle seat , please . I ' m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often . "
0,No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
0,What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ? 
0,Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
0,What happens if I can ' t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
0,"Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation ."
0,That ' s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ? 
0,"On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds ."
0,That ' s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ' m all set . You ' re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .
0,Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip ! 
0,I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ' re redecorating and are going to add some things . 
0,"Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week . "
0,Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
0,Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . 
1,That looks graceful on you . 
1,Thank you . But it is too bright for me . 
0,How about this brown one ? 
0,Let me try it on . I like that color . 
0,"Ok , i will get one for your . Here you are . "
0,But it is too loose . Do you have the smaller size ? 
1,"Sorry , it had been sold out . "
0,I ' d like to apply for a personal loan . 
0,How much would you like to borrow ? 
0,Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems . 
0,What ' s the current interest rate ? 
0,Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
0,And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside . 
0,"When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant . "
1,My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan . 
0,I wouldn't mind having one myself ... 
1,Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert ! 
0,"Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? "
0,"I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? "
0,"That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . "
0,A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? 
0,"A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . "
0,"But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . "
0,"We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . "
0,"I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . "
0,Hi . It ' s Tony calling from the dentist ' s office . Is Lily there ? 
0,"No , Lily is not here at the moment . "
0,Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? 
0,"Sure . What ' s your number , please . "
0,"Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ? "
1,Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much . 
0,So what do you think of my new dress ? 
1,"I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . "
0,"Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? "
0,I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
0,"Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? "
0,"I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . "
0,Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? 
0,Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? 
1,"No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . "
0,"No , I don't suppose he's to blame . The man in the other car made a mistake . "
0,But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
0,"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . "
0,"Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . "
0,"Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . "
0,"That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . "
0,"Yes , sometimes the differences are great . "
0,"Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . "
0,We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . 
1,I hate doing the damn laundry . 
0,I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ? 
0,"Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ?"
0,Turn to the next window and they will help you find one . 
0,Shall we share a taxi ? 
0,Where are you heading now ? 
0,I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . 
0,Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
0,You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
0,"Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . "
1,"Well . Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . "
0,Good morning.Are you Mr . Liu ? 
0,My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? 
0,"How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? "

0,"Okay . Mr . Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . "
1,That dress is very pretty . Why don ' t you like it ? 
1,We ' Ve been looking around for many hours . What on earth are you looking for ? 
0,"Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me . "
0,What style do you want ? 
0,"I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . "
0,"Oh , I see . How about the color ? "
0,I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . 
1,Really ? Let ' s go there . 
0,"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? "
1,Sure ! What do you feel like having ? 
1,I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! 
0,"Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? "
1,I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! 
0,"I'm not , I am a vegan . "
0,"A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . "
1,Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! 
0,"It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . "
0,How do you feel about that restaurant ? 
0,It wasn't all that great . 
0,What did you dislike the most ? 
0,I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . 
0,Did you think that the food was any good ? 
0,I wasn't all that impressed by the food . 
0,The service certainly could have been better . 
0,The service did not help the situation . 
0,Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? 
1,I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . 
0,Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ? 
0,No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden . 
0,How long are you going to stay here ? 
0,Do you have any dutiable items ? 
0,They are my personal effects . 
0,"I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went . "
0,"First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? "
0,I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . 
0,"I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ' t surprised when you move in . "
0,Wouldn ' t the owners have told me about any problems ? 
0,"Sellers aren ' t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ' t aware of . "
0,Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? 
0,You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . 
0,What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? 
0,There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . 
0,How you celebrate your Valentine ' s Day with your wife ? 
0,I will take a rain check . 
1,Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . 
0,Tell me what seems to be the problem . 
1,"My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . "
0,Did you ever talk to him about it ?

1,"Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! "
1,"Thanks , Jim . I didn ' t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . "
1,"No , we just don ' t usually admit it ! "
1,"Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! "
1,This Olympic park is so big ! 
0,"Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . "
1,Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? 
0,The whole stadium is to be finished this June . 
0,How many seats are there in the stand ? 
0,"Oh , there are 5000 seats in total ."
1,I didn ' t know it would be so big ! 
0,"It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . "
0,"Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . "
0,We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . 
0,"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . "
0,OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . 
0,"I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? "
0,"Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . "
0,"So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? "
1,"Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! "
0,That ' s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 
0,What was so bad about it ? 
0,"Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . "
0,Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . 
0,"Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor ."
0,"Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? "
0,"Yes , that ' s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 ."
1,"Yes , I ' m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . "
0,"Yes that ' s right . I ' Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ' m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . "
0,"Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? "
0,"Well I ' Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . "
0,"Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . "
0,"I ' m sure . Okay , now let ' s move on to your work experience , shall we ? "
0,"Could you change these for me , please ? "
0,"Twenties and some smaller bills , please . "
0,Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number . 
0,"Now , what seems to be the trouble ? "
0,"It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . "
0,"Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? "
0,"Yes , I never seem to have any energy . "
0,I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . 
0,"Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . "
0,Do you have a map of the campus ? 
0,"Yes , I have , but it doesn ' t help me very much . I ' m not very good at reading maps . "
0,Do you know where your classes are ? 
0,"More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ' t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . "
0,That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . 
0,"Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth . "
0,Which train do you like ? 
0,May I have your name ? 
0,I can ' t wait to vote . 
0,Who are you voting for ? 
0,The person I ' m voting for is the best . 
0,What do you like about him ? 
1,"That ' s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . "
1,I ' m glad to hear that you are so excited . 
1,I ' m voting for the next President . 
1,I ' m sure he will be . 
0,I ' m going to make sure and vote . 
0,Good morning . May I help you ? 
0,"Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key ."
0,"One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? "
0,What's the 14 pounds for ?
0,That's for the phone calls you made from your room . 
0,Can I pay with traveller's cheques ? 
0,"Certainly . May I have your passport , please ? "
0,Could you sign each cheque here for me ? 
1,"Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you . "
0,What type of people do you work with most effectively ? 
0,"I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . "
0,What things impress you in your colleagues ? 
0,I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . 
0,What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? 
0,"The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . "
0,How do you organize and plan for major projects ? 
0,"I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . "
0,Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . 
0,"I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me . Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . "
0,How do you manage your time in a typical day ? 
0,"I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . "
0,Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . 
0,I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . 
0,"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? "
1,"Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! "
0,I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . 
1,Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . 
0,It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . 
1,I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . 
0,"You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you ."
0,"He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . "
0,He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . 
0,Want to send out for some Chinese ? 
0,"Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . "
0,"No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? "
0,"Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . "
0,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 
0,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . "
0,What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . 
0,Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . 
0,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? 
0,I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . 
0,"It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . "
0,"If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . "
0,"Hello sir , how may I help you ? "
0,"I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . "
0,"I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? "
0,"It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry . "
0,Very well . This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . 
0,I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? 
0,"Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . "
0,I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! 
1,"I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? "
0,"Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . "
1,"Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
1,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? 
0,"I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . "
1,You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
0,I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . 
0,"Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . "
0,"Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . "
0,How many people are on the waiting list right now ? 
0,Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
0,How do you think they could be ended ? 
0,I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . 
0,"So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . "
0,"It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . "
0,"Yes , it is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . "
0,You still have not given me those files I ' Ve asked you for . 
0,"I ' m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ' Ve just been so busy today . "
1,"I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up . "
0,"You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now . "
0,What sort of job would you like to take ? 
0,I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . 
0,We need an operator now . 
0,It's just the job I've been searching for . 
0,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . 
0,I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . 
0,And it takes up all the news . 
0,The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . 
0,"It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . "
0,Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . 
0,I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . 
0,Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . 
0,"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? "
0,I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? 
0,"Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? "
0,Sure . Do you have my number ? 
0,"Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . "
0,No problem . I'll wait for your call . 
0,What are you typing there ? 
0,I'm working on my resume . 
1,Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? 
0,"Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . "
1,Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? 
0,I didn ' t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . 
0,Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . 
0,Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . 
0,But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . 
0,How do you know if you don ' t have a try ? 
0,Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? 
0,Is this the one you want ? 
0,"No , the one next to it . "
0,Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? 
0,It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? 
0,"Yes , please . How much is it ? "
1,It looks good . OK . I'll take it . 
1,Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . 
1,"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . "
1,I'm very glad to hear that . 
0,"Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . "
0,What's wrong with you ? You look pale . 
0,"I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . "
0,When did the trouble start ? 
0,I was sick most of the night . 
0,It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . 
0,Have I got a high fever ? 
0,"Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? "
0,"Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' "
0,"Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . "
0,The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . 
0,What shall I do today ? 
0,"I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . "
0,I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
0,"You can be sure of that , sir . "
0,I called HP about my computer . 
0,They said I need a new hard drive . 
0,That's too bad . How much is a new one ? 
0,"It's not too much , only about $ 85 ."
0,"No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . "
0,"Yes , it's just a couple of screws . "
0,It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
0,"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . "
0,"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class ."
0,Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . 
0,I ' m worried about my daughter . She can ' t decide about college . 
0,Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager . 
0,I don ' t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
0,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ' t affect her decision . 
0,But I just want to give her some tips . 
0,"Oh , she can make her own decisions . "
0,I guess you are right . 
0,Believe me . Everything will be ok . 
0,How long will we dock ? 
0,In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm . 
0,Yes . We come at the right time . 
1,"that was a really good meal , Gordon . "
1,It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . 
0,"well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . "
0,you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . 
0,let's see how much the bill is . 
0,don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 
0,what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . 
0,"no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . "
0,"no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . "
0,"alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . "
0,"that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . "
0,"just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? "
0,I hear you are planning to travel abroad . 
0,Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? 
0,"In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . "
0,Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . 
0,"Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . "
0,And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . 
1,This looks like a very nice house . 
1,"You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . "
1,The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for ! 
1,The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . 
1,This home is gorgeous on the inside ! 
0,"Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . "
1,The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . 
0,Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . 
1,I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . 
1,The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next . 
1,"There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . "
0,"I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . "
0,Room service . What can I do for you ? 
0,l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room . 
0,"Sorry sir , we will bring you one . Anything else ? "
0,Yes . Bring me a bath towel as well . 
0,Good afternoon.British Airline . Is there any thing I can do for you ? 
0,Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?
0,Sure . When do you want to take the plane ? 
0,Will that be first class or economy seat ? 
0,What's the fare for a first class seat ? 
0,Oh . I am not a wall streeter . Give me an economy one please . 
0,"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? "
0,"Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . "
0,"That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . "
0,And I can purchase that here ? 
0,"Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . "
0,Are there any beds vacant ? 
0,"Yes , what kind of room do you want ? "
0,"I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . "
0,"Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . "
0,Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
0,That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . 
1,You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? 
0,"Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t "
0,"Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? "
0,"Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . "
0,"Well , welcome to the team . "
0,Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . 
0,Is there anything I can do for you now ? 
0,Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . 
0,Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? 
0,"Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . "
0,"All right , could I leave a message ? "
0,Please ask her to call John . 
0,Excuse me . Where is the way out ? 
0,"Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . "
0,"It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? "
0,"Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? "
0,It should be the way out . 
0,OK . Let's go and see . 
0,"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . "
1,"Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . "
0,I think you should be more careful next time . 
1,"Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . "
0,"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . "
0,"Look , Sally . I ' Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . "
0,"No , I ' m sorry . I disagree . I don ' t think you ' Ve been working at full speed at all . "
1,Well . I ' m sorry you feel that way . 
0,"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? "
0,"Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? "
0,"Things are going well for me , Joe . "
0,Want to go see a movie tonight ? 
0,My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . 
0,"Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? "
0,What movie did you want to see ? 
0,There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . 
0,I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 
0,Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! 
1,Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . 
1,"Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! "
1,I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! 
0,Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . 
0,"You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... "
0,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? 
0,"Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . "
1,Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . 
0,"I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . "
0,Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? 
0,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . 
1,Promise that you won't get angry . 
0,"OK , I promise . What is it ? "
1,"Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . "
0,"Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . "
1,No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
0,"Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . "
0,All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . 
1,"I will . Thank you , Mummy . "
0,I was wondering if you could help me with something . 
0,"Actually , it ' s a little bit silly . "
1,"Don ' t worry about it , just ask . "
0,What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? 
0,You need to know the type of shoes you want . 
0,Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . 
0,"The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . "
0,Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon . 
0,Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? 
0,It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
0,"So , it has a history for more than a decade ? "
0,Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
0,"What can I do for you , Madam ? "
0,Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? 
0,"Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? "
0,"All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . "
0,Let's do something outdoors today . 
0,All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . 
0,Okay . what do you want to do ? 
0,I want to go jogging . 
1,All right . That sounds like fun . 
0,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month . This is my reservation note . 
0,"I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled ."
0,"But I have been so busy all these days . Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . "
0,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . 
0,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . 
0,"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . "
0,"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? "
0,"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . "
0,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? 
0,"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . "
0,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? 
1,"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . "
0,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? 
0,"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . "
0,"You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . "
0,"OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? "
0,"I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . "
0,"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . "
0,What size do you want ? 
0,How about this one ? It's the latest design . 
1,"Oh , I like the color . "
0,I'm looking for a pair of shoes . 
0,What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
0,I wear size 36.This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ?
1,"Of course , yes.They look nice . And they're not expensive . "
0,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 
0,I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
0,"Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . "
0,"Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . "
0,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . "
0,"Ok , then we can sign up for it together . "
0,Who's it knocking at the door ? 
0,I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door ? 
0,All right . I'll get it . 
0,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? 
0,"How many of you , please ? "
0,I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . 
0,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . "
0,"If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . "
0,Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ? 
0,I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . 
0,Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? 
0,"Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . "
0,How will I know what the numbers mean ? 
0,You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . 
0,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? 
0,We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . 
0,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . "
0,If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
0,What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
0,I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? 
0,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway ."
0,Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
0,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
0,That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
0,OK . We can meet halfway again . 
0,"Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? "
0,"No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? "
0,"Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? "
0,B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . 
1,"Oh , you mean Canal Street ? "
0,That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . 
0,"Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? "
0,"At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?"
0,I cannot get hold of her yet . 
0,Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? 
0,"Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . "
0,What about your use of raw materials ? 
0,"Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ' re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . "
0,What happens if you exceed the limits ? 
0,We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . 
0,Have you got any better ? 
0,That's the best there is . 
0,"Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ? "
0,"Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ? "
1,"No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back . "

0,"I don ' t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . "
0,What words ? Can you tell me ? 
0,"He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ' t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ' t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . "
0,"Honey , I don ' t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . "
0,"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . "
0,"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . "
0,"It ' s easy to say , but I will try . "
0,"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . "
0,"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ' t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . "
0,How can I help you ? 
0,"Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . "
0,Do you have an appointment ? 
0,"Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock ."
0,I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
0,"Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? "
0,That would be very nice . Thank you . 
0,"Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared"
0,did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? 
0,"no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . "
0,"yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . "
0,they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . 
0,they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . 
0,I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . 
0,did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? 
0,"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . "
0,"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? "
0,"yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . "
0,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 
0,people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
0,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 
0,that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . 
0,thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 
0,"being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . "
0,Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .

0,"It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . "
0,"Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . "
0,"Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . "
0,"OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs ."

0,That would be nice . How are you getting there ? 
0,"Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . "
0,"Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... "
0,And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . 
0,But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . 
0,"Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? "
0,I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .

0,"Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number . "
0,Isn't this the car store ? 
0,No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods . 
0,"Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ? "
0,No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book . 
1,I'm sorry to have bothered you . 
0,How about going to the cinema tonight ? 
0,That's great . What's on tonight ? 
0,"I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . "
0,Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
0,Don't you think it's too bloody ? 
1,"On the contrary , very exciting . "
0,"Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ' t make it on that day . "

0,How much are you selling it for ? 
0,This t . v is only $ 2500 .

0,I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . 
0,Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? 
0,I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life . 
0,"Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ? "
0,"You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? "
0,"That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? "

0,"Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus ."
1,"Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 ."
0,But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
0,"Ah , thank you . Please bring your luggage here for inspection . "
0,Ok . But is there anything wrong ? 
0,It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ? 
0,"I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne . Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift ."
0,"Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free . You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . "

0,"Yes , I ' m satisfied with this job . "

0,"Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . "
0,How can I have the good external expressions ? 
0,"Don ' t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ' s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language . "
1,"Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... "

0,I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper . 
0,OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ? 
0,What were you planning on seeing ? 
0,I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . 
0,How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ? 
0,What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
0,"First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . "
0,That ' s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ' ll need someone to hire staff . 
0,"I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of "
0,"Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . "
0,Why didn ' t we choose an office in the CBD ? 
0,The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
0,Yes . We ' Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .

0,I want to pick up my valuables . 
0,May I have your key please ? 
0,Here is your valuable . Is that right ? 
0,did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? 
0,why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . 
0,"well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . "
0,do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? 
0,"no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . "
0,it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . 
0,"religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . "
0,what do you think about abortion ? 
0,"I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . "
0,do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? 
0,"I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . "
0,"why not ? It's their children , too . "
0,"that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . "
0,"that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . "
0,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . "
0,But I don't have any reading assignments . 
0,Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep . 
1,"Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . "
0,"You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . "
0,I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position . 
0,"Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . "
0,Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? 
0,We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply . 
0,I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision . 
0,How did you find your apartment ? 
0,You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . 
0,What if I need a roommate ? 
0,There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . 
0,How much do apartments cost around here ? 
0,It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? 
0,I just need a one-bedroom apartment . 
0,That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . 
0,Would you come with me to look at apartments ? 
1,I would be happy to look at apartments with you . 
0,Have you heard what happened ? 
0,Deborah already had her baby . 
0,The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
0,Will you go and visit them ? 
0,I just wanted to give you the good news . 
0,Thanks for letting me know . 
1,How silly of you to jump out of the window ! 
0,But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! 
0,Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . 
0,That would be too late . 
0,Maybe the situation is too urgent . 
0,"Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . "
0,I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . 
0,I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself . 
0,What foods do you eat now ? 
0,"I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . "
0,Those are the only things you eat ? 
0,That's basically what I eat . 
0,Why aren't you eating anything else ? 
0,"Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . "
0,It's really healthy to eat when you bake it . 
1,I guess that does sound a lot healthier . 
1,Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office . 
1,Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! 
1,Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams . 
1,Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith . 
1,Today is my first day at work ! 
1,"Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help . "
1,Thank you . It's very kind of you . 
0,Do you have experience in advertising ? 
0,"Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . "
0,What were you mean duties there ? 
0,I mostly did advertising planning . 
0,What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? 
0,"I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . "
0,What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? 
0,"The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating . "
0,The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
0,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . 
0,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying ! 
0,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded . 
0,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
0,Do you have anything to do after this ? 
1,Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? 
1,That sounds like a good idea . 
1,I know a very interesting place . 
0,"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? "
0,"I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . "
0,"I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . "
0,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . 
0,I know . I wonder what's keeping him .

0,What kind of music do you prefer then ? 
0,I like pop music . Do you ? 
0,Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . 
0,I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 
0,"How long have you been in to pop music , then ? "
0,I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? 
0,"Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . "
0,"So , how did you become interested in it ? "
0,"Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started ."
0,Do you still play piano ? 
0,"Yes , it's one of my hobbies . "
0,"Hi Paul . How are you , friend . "

1,"Thank you , dear . I feel better now . "
0,Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . 
0,I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . 
0,Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? 
0,"I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . "
0,That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? 
0,I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . 
0,I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? 
0,I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .

0,"Come on , don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine . "
1,"You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ? "
0,"But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . "
1,He ' s the love of my life ! I ' Ve really messed this up . 
0,"Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright . "
1,"But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up ! "
0,"You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ... "
1,"No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ' Ve ruined everything ... "

1,ok . Then I can make up my mind . 
0,Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? 
0,I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . 
0,Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? 
0,"Oh , I can't . I have a date ! "
0,This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . 
0,"Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? "
0,"Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . "
0,That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? 
0,"It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . "
0,I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! 
0,"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . "
1,Stay for dinner with us . 
0,"I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . "

0,"Honey , do you have a second ? "
0,Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried . What ' s on your mind ? 
0,"I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . "
1,"What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ? "
1,"That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! "
1,"So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ? "
1,"Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry . "
1,"Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me . "
1,"I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . "
1,"Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye . "
0,"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . "
0,"What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . "
0,I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . 
0,Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . 
0,You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? 
0,But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . 
0,"Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . "
0,Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . 
0,I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . 
0,Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . 
0,That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . 
0,How about a training course ? 
0,A training course ? That must be costly . 
0,But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . 
0,"OK , let's have a try . "
0,Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? 
0,Yes . What did you think of it ?

0,What's the color of her eyes ? 
0,I'm going to buy a CD . 
0,Why not listen to music online ? 
0,"Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? "
0,"You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . "
0,"I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . "
0,"In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . "
0,Can you recommend some to me ? 
0,Certainly . Realplayer is a good . 
0,"Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . "
0,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . 
0,"Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . "
0,"Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? "
0,He asked me how long it took me to learn English . 
1,"But , you were born and raised in California ! "
0,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . "
1,What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? 
0,"You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . "
0,"So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? "
0,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it ."
0,Are you sure he really got the message ? 
0,"Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . "
0,That's hilarious ! What did he say ? 
0,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good ."
0,I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . 
0,Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? 
0,"Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . "
0,I see . Did they succeed in the end ? 
0,Of course not . He drowned . 
0,What can I do for you today ? 
0,I would like to use a computer . 
0,Do you have your library card ? 
0,There is a wait for the computers . 
0,You need to print your name on this list . 
0,"Once a computer is available , I will let you know . "
0,How am I supposed to log on to the computer ? 
0,All you do is type in the number on the back of your card . 
1,That ' s it ? Thank you very much . 
0,"how are you doing , Christopher ? "
1,"to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! "
0,are you doing anything this weekend ? 
1,I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
0,are you available on Sunday ? 
0,"yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . "
0,"ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? "
0,that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
0,it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
0,what should I bring with me ? 
0,"we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . "
0,I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . 
0,I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? 
1,we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
0,I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 
0,"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money ."
0,"ok , where and when should I meet you ? "
1,we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
0,I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . 
0,It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . 
0,I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! 
0,Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . 
0,"No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . "
0,Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 
0,Good idea . That might help . 
0,He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means . 
0,"You are interested in other people ' s business , aren ' t you ? "
0,Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ' m noisy ? 
0,"Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . "
1,"My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? "
1,"I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants ."
1,"Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? "
0,How old are your children ? 
0,I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
0,I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . 
1,It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . 
0,"Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . "
0,Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . 
0,And after church they come here for lunch ? 
0,"Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? "
0,"Yeah , what's up with that ? "
0,"The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! "
1,Hi ! I'm happy you could make it . 
1,"Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you . "
1,What can I get you ? 
1,I'd love a gin and tonic . 
0,Could you please help me to check out the book ? 
0,"Sure , what's the author's name , please . "
0,I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ... 
0,"No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature . "
0,"OK , do you know the title of the book ? "
0,"Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . "
0,"So , show me the note please . "
0,I can't find it now . 
0,"Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ? "
0,Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography . 
0,"OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please . "
0,How do you decide what grade we get ? 
0,"I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . "
0,What is the most important factor ? 
0,"Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . "
0,How can we keep track of our grades ? 
0,"The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent ."
0,What if we can't get to school ? 
0,You can only miss one class without penalty . 
0,"If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? "
0,I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . 
0,We're thinking about going to America . 
0,Have you thought about the cost ? 
0,I believe it'll be very expensive . 
0,May I help you with something ? 
0,I would like to return some books . 
0,These books were due two weeks ago . 
0,Yeah . I totally forgot they were due . 
0,You will need to pay late fees on these books . 
0,How much are the late fees ? 
0,The fee is 25 cents every day .
1,I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
0,And that ' s for each book that is late . 
0,That shouldn ' t be a problem . 
1,This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! 
1,It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ' m going to take a dip . 
1,Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! 
0,"I get too tired ! I ' ll just backstroke , it ' s easier ! "
0,Try kicking your legs more . That ' s good . Don ' t go out too far ! 
0,It ' s fine . Jump in ! 
0,Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! 
0,Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! 
0,It ' s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! 
0,"what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? "
0,my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
0,three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! 
0,"well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . "
0,were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 
0,"I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . "
0,did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 
0,"my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t "
0,that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 
0,we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
0,"you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? "
0,"not at all , but we don ' t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! "
0,"Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? "
0,"I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . "
0,"I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . "
0,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . 
1,I know . I wonder what's keeping him . 
0,"Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? "
1,"Yeah , a number of times . "
0,What's he trying to pull anyway . 
1,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . 
0,Maybe you should start seeing someone else . 
1,"You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . "
0,"So , you ' re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ' s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?"

0,"I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . "
0,"And , who is sponsoring your trip ? "
0,"My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . "
0,"Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . "
0,"Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . "
0,And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? 
1,"Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . "
1,"I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !"
0,"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? "
0,"Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . "
1,"Oh , that's good news for us . "
0,So what do you provide ? 
0,"First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits . "
0,How can you get that done ? 
0,"Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . "

0,"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . "
0,Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . 
1,Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it . 
0,Do you watch a lot of TV ? 
0,Not really . I could take it or leave it . 
0,Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 
0,How can you do that ? 
0,My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? 
0,My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you . 
0,Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ? 
0,No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? 
0,Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . 
0,Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? 
0,"I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . "
0,"I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . "
0,Why were you in Japan ? 
0,My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . 
0,I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . 
0,"Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . "
1,"Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . "
0,Guess who I saw just now ? 
0,"John Smith , the escaped criminal . "
1,"That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . "
0,I think I must report to the cops . 
0,What do you think of this one ? 
0,And this one ? Too flashy ? 
0,Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ? 
0,Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you . 
1,"And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes ! "
1,Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
1,Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
1,"Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! "
1,"Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? "
1,I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
0,Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ' s OK . 
0,"Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious . "
0,I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . 
0,"I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . "
0,It must have really hurt afterwards . 
0,"Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing ."
0,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . 
0,"I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !"
0,Is there any pain now ? 
0,"No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . "
0,Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? 
0,"Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . "
1,I had a fantastic time . 
0,"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? "
0,"Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . "
1,Why ? You ' re not satisfied anymore ? 
0,"I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . "
1,That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . 
1,"Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . "
1,"Ok , good luck to you . "
0,"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? "
0,Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . 
0,But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 
0,He is more nice than wise . 
0,"Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? "
0,"Yes , is that you , Allen ? "
0,"Yes , how are you doing ? "
1,Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ? 
1,Sure . Thank you very much . 
1,Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
0,The weather has been terrible this week . 
0,"Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . "
0,Let's hope it clears up . 
1,Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 
1,"If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . "
0,"Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? "
0,"I , I don't know how to explain it to you . "
0,"Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? "
0,"Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . "
0,"How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ' m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card . "
1,"It ' s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens . "
0,"Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please . "
1,I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . 
0,Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? 
0,"Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . "
0,What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? 
0,"Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . "
0,"That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . "
0,But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . 
1,"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? "
1,That sounds great . Where are you going ? 
1,"I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . "
1,Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . 
0,What do you think of doctor Thomson ? 
0,I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
0,How can you be so sure ? 
0,I can tell form the way he spoke to us . 
0,Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . 
0,I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . 
0,"Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . "
0,"Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . "
0,What do you think about violence in movies ? 
0,"Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . "
0,"But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? "
0,"If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . "
0,Are you free tomorrow night ? 
1,Shall we have dinner together ? 
1,Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 
1,"Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . "
1,OK . I'll be happy to join you . 
0,If only our company prescribe flex time . 
0,The board has been considering introducing flex time . 
1,"Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . "
1,Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . 
0,"Brian , do you know how to speak English ? "
0,How long have you been in the U . S . ? 
0,Is your wife with you ? 
0,"Yes , she just got here yesterday . "
0,Have you been to California before ? 
0,No . I've never been there . 
0,Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? 
0,Yes . I went there once on a business trip . 
0,How are the children doing at sport ? 
0,I ' m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ' s very fast for a kid his age .
0,"He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? "
0,"He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age . "
0,Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 
0,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
0,How are they at swimming ? 
0,"They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape ."
0,Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
1,I ' d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
0,"I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . "
0,"It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . "
1,"Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?"
1,"Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day ."
1,Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
1,"Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... "
1,"Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . "
1,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
1,"Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . "
1,"It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . "
1,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
1,I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
1,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
0,"Sorry , I thought you knew . "
1,But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
0,"Well , I'm telling you now . "
1,"Yes , but you might have told me before . "
0,I didn't think you'd be interested . 
1,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
0,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . "
1,"Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
0,"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? "
0,Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
0,What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 
0,I ' m fine . Thank you . 
0,I need you to help me . 
0,What can I do for you ? 
0,I am looking for an article in a newspaper . 
0,Did you check the periodicals ? 
0,I didn ' t even bother to think of that . 
0,I ' ll show you where to find your article . 
0,I get lost in this library . 
0,It ' s right this way . 
1,Thanks a lot for your help . 
0,How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . 
0,Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? 
1,"No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?"
1,All right . See you tomorrow night . 
0,"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? "
0,I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
0,"Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . "
1,I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . 
0,Why don't you take a few days off ? 
1,I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
0,"Yes , I can , but not very well . "
0,Where did you learn it ? 
0,At school . And I'm still learning it now . 
0,How long have you been learning it ? 
0,Can you speak any other languages ? 
0,"Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? "
1,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
0,God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? 
0,"Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . "
0,They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . 
0,I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . 
0,You'd better pay more attention to your health . 
1,"I will , thanks for your concern . "
0,It is too bad today . 
0,"My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . "
0,How did you find him at last ? 
0,It was the police wo helped me to do that . 
0,It must have taught you a lesson this time . 
0,I want to give our kitchen the works . 
0,Why ? I think it ' s convenient and good . 
0,No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ' s modern . 
0,Why should we run after the fashion ? 
0,I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . 
1,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 
1,I'm crazy about it . It makes me very excited . 
1,Then tell me what's good about it . 
1,It can't be expressed by words . 
0,What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . 
0,I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . 
1,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . "
1,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . "
1,"Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . "
1,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . "
1,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? "
1,"Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . "
0,Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . 
1,"That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . "
1,Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . 
1,"Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . "
0,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
0,What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
0,"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . "
0,"I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! "
0,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! "
0,"That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time ! "
0,I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?

0,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?

0,You ' re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ' s you favourite award category ? 
0,"You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . "
1,It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . 
0,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? 
0,We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . 
0,Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . 
0,But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
0,How do you celebrate national day in your country ? 
0,There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . 
0,What kinds of parades are there ? 
0,"The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? "
0,We don ' t have a national day . 
0,"I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t . "
0,"Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . "

0,"Hey , how was the show ? "
1,Not great . It's a kind of boring . 
1,Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . 
1,"Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . "
0,Why do you look unhappy ? 
0,I ' m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
0,"Oh , cheer up . He ' ll understand you . "
0,You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . 
0,But I think Henry is a backroom boy . He always helps her with her study . 
1,"Hi , Tina , I ' Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . "
1,That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .

0,"Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?"

0,I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? 
0,I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . 
0,Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? 
0,"As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . "
1,Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! 
0,"Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . "
0,"But not as good as your mother's , right ? "
0,No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 
1,"Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! "
1,"OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... "
0,How many people are there in your family ? 
0,"Five . My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . "
0,Is your brother older or younger than you ? 
0,"He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday . My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . "
0,"Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? "
0,"I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . "
0,Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? 
0,"I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . "
0,Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
0,"No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? "
1,"Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot . There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
0,How much was the ticket ? 
0,I only paid two dollars for mine . 
0,Mary and Tom are breaking up . 
1,It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? 
0,"Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . "
0,Do you think they'll become reconciled ? 
0,"No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . "
0,What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . 
0,have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 
0,sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
0,"as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? "
0,"to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . "
0,but you look quite proficient in using them now . 
0,"certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch "
0,"yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i "
0,"maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . "
0,"oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . "
1,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
0,Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . 
0,You'd better cool yourself down first . 
0,"Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . "
0,How many credits for each course ? 
0,"Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . "
0,"Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . "
1,I hate to go outside . 
0,Why do you hate to go outside ? 
1,I meet too many jerks . 
1,This city is full of jerks . 
0,But what can you do ? 
1,You can yell at them . 
1,And they will yell back at you . 
0,Yelling doesn't do any good . 
0,No . The best thing to do is just stay home . 
0,"I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . "
0,You mean you suspect him . 
0,I ' m not sure . I ' ll try to prove my feeling . 
0,I hope I can do something for you . 
1,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
0,"Yeah , those classics from the great writers . "
0,But I find Japanese ones better . 
0,Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
0,Why doesn't he ask her ? 
0,He is too scared to ask her . 
0,What does the paper say ? 
0,Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . 
0,"Well , what ' s the weather report ? "

0,Until next weekend . that ' s ok . 
0,They ' ll do the operation for you this Friday .

0,I think it ' s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . 
0,But it won ' t be on my birthday . 
0,But your health is more important . Believe me ! 
1,Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . 
0,Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . 
1,"If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . "
0,Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .

0,I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . 
1,Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
0,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
1,There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
0,"Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . "
0,I think my arm is broken . 
0,"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . "
0,"Listen , let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . "
0,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . 
0,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? "
1,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
0,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . "
1,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
0,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . "
0,"Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? "
1,To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
0,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? "
0,"Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ? "
0,Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?

1,"That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . "
0,I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed . 
1,Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
0,The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . 
0,And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 
0,Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ? 
0,What's your excuse this time ? 
0,Have I used the one that my sister is sick ? 
0,Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother . 
0,I don't think so . But it could've been . 
0,Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die . 
1,"I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? "
0,Just try to be a little more punctual in the future . 
0,I'm working on it . Really ! 
0,"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . "
0,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . 
0,"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . "
0,"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . "
0,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 
0,"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . "
1,"Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . "

1,"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . "
1,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . "
1,"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . "
1,"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? "
1,"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . "
1,"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . "
1,And the host announced that he won it all ! 
0,"Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ' t you meet me there ? "
0,I thought we were supposed to meet here . 
0,Don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
0,I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . 
0,Why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
0,You ' re right . I am sorry . Let ' s go and watch the movie . 
0,It ' s okay . I don ' t want to go now . We ' Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ' t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .

0,That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . 
0,eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .

0,I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . 
1,"The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . "
1,I can ' t bear it . The driver is too bad . 
0,He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .

0,"Oh , that's how you see it . "
0,That way they look longer . 
0,Now what are you doing ? 
1,Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . 
0,And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . 
0,Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ? 
0,"Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ? "
0,"Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something . "
0,I have a great idea of where you might like to go . 
0,It's on the second floor . May I join you ? 
1,What are you going to do next year ? 
1,I want to go traveling . 
1,Do you have any where in mind ? 
1,"Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . "
0,"Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ' t believe you are listening at all . "
0,"Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . "
0,"Don ' t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . "
0,But he still does not come back . 
0,Maybe he is on the way home now . 
0,How long have you been in England ? 
1,Almost two years ? Your English is very good . 
1,Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . 
0,"The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? "
0,Johnson ? I can't place them . 
0,We met them in Bermuda last May . 
0,They've completely slipped my mind . 
0,"The couple with the dogs , think back . "
0,"No , I don't recall a thing about them . "
0,"Well , I've invited them for brunch . "
0,"Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . "
0,His grandfather is the richest person in the area . 
0,What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . 
0,His grandfather's money is not his . 
0,I can't understand him anyway . 
0,He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
1,"It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . "
1,"Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . "
0,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . "
1,Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
0,"yes , I am the guy ... "
1,what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
0,let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
1,We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? 
0,"Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time . "
1,"Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! "
1,"All right , just a quick one . "
0,Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? 
0,Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . 
0,"Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name ."
0,OK . Then tell me what else you know .

0,"He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? "
0,"Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' "
0,Indeed you know much about him . 
0,This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . 
1,"I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . "
1,I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow . 
0,"No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that . "
0,May I ask a question ? 
0,What does mph stand for ?

1,"Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? "
0,' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .

0,"Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ? "
0,I believe there ' s a sitcom . 
0,Are you interested in watching it ? 
0,Let me look in the TV Guide first . 
0,"Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?"
0,"If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show . "
0,Do you want to watch it ? 
0,"Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? "
0,"Tell me about it , will you ? "
1,"Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight . "
0,Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? 
1,"Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . "
1,You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? 
1,We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . 
1,So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
1,"Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . "
0,Susan is going to get a divorce . 
0,How do you know that ? 
0,"She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . "
0,"Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . "
0,Here's the course description guide . 
0,What do I do with it ? 
0,Do you want me to help you ? 
0,Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them . 
0,So I don't have to worry about them . 
0,"You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... "
0,Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . 
0,"Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . "
0,But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . 
0,"They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . "
0,That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . 
0,"Ann , do you have time next Monday ? "
1,"Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party . "
1,"Five o ' clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? "
1,"Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation . "

0,Hey Stacy . What's going on ? 
0,I'm pretty tired these days . 
0,Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? 
0,"I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . "
0,How about your husband . Does he help much ? 
0,Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? 
0,"If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? "
0,Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? 
0,Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
0,"Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? "
0,Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
0,"That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . "
0,Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
0,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . "
0,"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? "
0,"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . "
0,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
0,"Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . "
0,You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
0,How do you arrange this summer vacation ? 
0,Where would you like to go ? 
1,That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
1,"I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . "
1,"Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . "
1,"Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? "
1,"No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . "
1,Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . 
0,I'm dreadfully sorry for you . 
1,Thank you very much for your kindness . 
1,"Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . "
0,"Oh , I ' ll go to shanghai to practice there . "
1,That ' s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . 
1,"I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . "
1,And English is very useful in your job . 
1,"I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . "
1,You will be a very promising one . 
0,I hear you are expecting your family . 
0,"Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . "
1,I didn't know you had a brother . 
0,"Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . "
1,"Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? "
0,His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . 
0,Does your brother have just one son ? 
0,"No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . "
0,I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . 
0,"Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . "
0,So when are they all coming ? 
0,My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . 
0,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
0,I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
0,Where did you spend your holiday ? 
0,"So , Paula , where are you from ? "
0,From Canada ? Where were you born ? 
0,When did you come to Los Angeles ? 
0,We moved here when I was fourteen . 
0,Did you go to school here ? 
0,"Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . "
0,Did you get a job right after graduation ? 
0,"No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . "
0,Let's see ... That was about six years ago . 
0,I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? 
0,I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me . How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? 
0,Do you consider yourself a good mother ? 
1,"Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . "
0,"How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . "
1,"I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . "
0,Does your husband feel the same ? 
1,Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . 
0,"I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . "
0,"let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . "
0,"I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people . "
0,"you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . "
0,I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense . 
0,we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . 
0,that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? 
0,that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . 
0,I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . 
0,"the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how . "
0,He used to be a policeman . 
0,But Mrs . Smith hired him to find her lost son . 
0,Yeah . He's a private eye now . 
0,Where do they come from ? 
0,I don't know . Something rotten here ? 
0,Have you got your invitation yet ? 
1,"My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? "
0,Whose house warming party is it ? 
0,Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . 
0,"Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . "
0,It's out in the suburbs . 
0,Have you seen the house ? 
0,"Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . "
1,"Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . "
1,"Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? "
1,"They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . "
1,When are they going to have the party ? 
1,Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . 
1,"Wow , that would be something to look forward to . "
0,"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? "
0,I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
0,"oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? "
0,"we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec "
1,wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! 
0,tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 
0,"perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . "
0,"no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . "
0,"we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . "
1,"great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . "
1,no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 
1,"Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . "
0,"Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . "
0,Sounds good . Where are we going ? 
0,Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . 
0,"Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? "
0,"Yeah , I broke up with Lisa . She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! "
0,Whew ! That getup is terrific ! 
0,Never mind the getup . She ' s beautiful ! 
0,"If you're lucky , that might do the trick . "
0,"Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . "
0,Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? 
0,"My ex-girlfriend's here . If she sees me , my goose is cooked . "
0,I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . 
1,Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ' s been such a long time ! 
1,"Darlene ! Indeed , it ' s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ' Ve done with your hair ! "
1,"Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ' t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! "
1,"Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ' Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! "
1,"Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . "
1,He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
1,"Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . "
1,Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
1,Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
1,"But of course ! Well , it ' s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . "
1,"Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! "
1,That would be great ! Give me a call ! 
1,See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
0,Did you already take the history exam ? 
0,Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? 
0,I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 
0,Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . 
0,What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? 
0,I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
0,"Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . "
0,"If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . "
0,Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . 
0,"What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . "
0,"What do you mean by "" us "" ? "
0,"Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ? "
0,"What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? "
0,"Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . "
0,Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? 
0,Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? 
1,"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? "
1,Yes . Do you like it ? 
1,It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . 
1,Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . 
1,Is classical music your favorite ? 
0,I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . 
0,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . 
0,"Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . "
0,Did you always like pop music . 
0,"I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . "
0,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . 
1,"oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . "
0,"Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . "
0,It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . 
0,Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? 
0,Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . 
0,"Fortunately , things are changing these years . "
0,"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . "
0,"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? "
0,"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . "
0,I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . 
0,"i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday . "
0,"Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . "
0,"Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . "
0,"I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . "
0,"Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? "
0,"Yeah , I ' m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . "
0,"Oh , do you go hiking often ? "
1,I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
1,It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
1,"Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?"
1,"Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . "
1,Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
1,"Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . "
1,"Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend . "
0,"Thanks , I ' ll ask him . "
1,How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! 
1,I don't know if anything terrible has happened . 
0,I have reported it to the police . 
0,We'd better prepare for the worst . 
0,"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? "
0,"He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?"
0,I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . 
0,I can think of better things to dream about ... 
0,"Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . "
1,Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
0,What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! 
0,It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
0,What are you looking for now ? 
0,"Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin . "
0,In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
0,Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? 
0,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . "
0,It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . 
0,Are you Chinese by birth ? 
0,"Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . "
0,How do you like it ? 
0,I like it so far . But my English still needs work . 
0,I want to study Mandarin and public relations . 
1,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . "
1,Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
0,Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
0,Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
0,You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? 
0,They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
1,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? "
0,"Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . "
0,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
1,You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . 
1,"Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! "
1,"Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! "
1,How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? 
1,Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
1,Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! 
1,"The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . "
1,What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! 
0,Let ' s play a game ! 
0,"No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ' m going to describe someone ' s face , and you guess who it is ! "
0,"Let ' s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! "
0,"Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! "
0,"Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! "
0,"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . "
0,"It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . "
0,Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
0,"For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . "
0,That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 
0,"Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . "
1,"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . "
1,You are invited to my wedding . 
1,Thank you . I'll certainly be there . 
0,Thank you for lending me the book . 
0,"Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . "
0,But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . 
0,Don ' t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? 
0,I ' m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . 
0,"Don ' t you think in that case , there wouldn ' t be so much stealing ? "
0,Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . 
0,"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? "
0,"Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . "
0,That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 
0,It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 
0,Yeah . I think I can find it . 
0,You're back already . That sure was quick . 
0,That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . 
0,"Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . "
1,"Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . "
0,"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? "
0,"well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . "
1,"what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . "
1,"oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? "
0,"actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? "
0,"art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . "
0,really impressive . These two genres are totally different . 
0,sure . I enjoy both of them very much . 
0,how often do you go to the cinema ? 
0,"once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . "
0,movie salon ? where is that ? 
0,it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . 
0,"yes , you can find almost all new releases there . "
0,really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . 
1,Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! 
1,Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . 
1,Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
1,That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? 
0,Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? 
0,"I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . "
1,Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . 
0,I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . 
0,There are so many things you have to prepare for . 
0,"I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . "
1,It really must be an exciting time for you guys . 
0,Mary seems depressed . What ' s the matter ? 
0,She didn ' t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ' s hard work . 
0,"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide ."
1,Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? 
0,"That's what I'm wondering , too . "
0,I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . 
1,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 
0,"Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . "
1,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? "
0,"Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . "
1,What a pity ! You can't join us . 
1,"So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . "
1,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? "
1,Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . 
0,"Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? "
0,ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
0,That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . 
1,Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . 
0,"If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop . "
1,I did . But they said they won ' t change them . 
0,"That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do . "
0,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
0,Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
0,Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
0,"Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . "
0,You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
0,It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
0,"But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . "
0,"I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . "
0,I am so busy today . 
0,I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
1,I ' ll be glad to help . 
0,Or maybe make the beds . 
1,All you have to do is ask for help . 
1,I ' m ready and willing to help . 
0,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . "
1,Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? 
1,Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . 
0,Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? 
0,"I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . "
0,You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . 
0,You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . 
0,I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . 
0,"Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu ."
0,Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . 
0,Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 
0,You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
0,"Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . "
0,"Zach , what's that on your arm ? "
0,"I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . "
0,It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 
0,"Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . "
0,I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . 
0,Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 
0,"We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . "
0,Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
0,I can't go to your party . 
0,Do you like being a doctor ? 
0,"Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . "
0,Can you tell me about it ? 
0,"You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . "
0,What can you do when this happens ? 
0,"Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . "
0,It's too hot to read . 
0,We'd better go out for a walk . 
0,Which season do you like best ? 
0,Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 
0,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
0,My son came home from three years in the navy . 
0,It was a real red letter day for you . 
0,Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
0,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? "
1,"Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? "
1,"It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day ."
1,"You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? "
0,"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . "
0,"I ' m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . "
0,"I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? "
0,"Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . "
1,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation . 
0,I know why we have reservations . 
1,"I don ' t think you do.If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . "
0,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like . 
1,Fine . I ' ll take the compact . 
0,"Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? "
1,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . "
0,Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
0,"No , I think Harry will get it . "
0,Let's make a bet on who gets it . 
0,"OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . "
0,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
0,"Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . "
0,"You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ? "
0,"To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . "
0,"But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . "
0,What happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
0,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
1,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
0,"If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . "
1,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
0,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
1,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
1,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
1,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
1,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! "
0,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . "
0,"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . "
0,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? "
0,That's because Americans love sitcoms . 
0,"Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . "
0,"In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . "
0,I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . 
0,Are you interested in history ? 
1,"Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . "
1,"I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . "
0,I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 
0,Some people say that history repeats itself . 
0,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? "
0,"The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . "
0,I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . 
0,"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . "
0,"You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . "
0,"Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . "
0,It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . 
0,Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? 
0,"Yes , they say I would get a big sum . "
0,Have you discussed it with your wife ? 
0,"Yes , she leaves it to me . "
0,As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . 
0,I have to think about it . 
0,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? 
0,"Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . "
0,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
0,That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics . 
0,I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ? 
0,"I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . "
0,What do you think our chance are in other events . 
0,"In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events . "
0,We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . 
0,I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
1,"Helen , did you hear I ' m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . "
0,"I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . "
0,"Well , drop by if you can . "
0,"I will , do you want me to bring anything ? "
1,"No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . "
0,It's said that John's broken up . 
1,Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . 
0,I hear that John's leading a double wife . 
1,It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . 
0,I haven't played chess for a long time . 
0,"That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . "
0,"Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . "
0,You're a very good player 
0,"Not really , but once I won a prize . "
0,So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . 
0,My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . 
0,You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 
0,Do you know Chinese better now ? 
0,"Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . "
0,"Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . "
0,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . "
0,A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it . 
0,I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . 
0,"Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us . "
0,"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? "
0,Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? 
0,"Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . "
0,Have you ever read this book before ? 
0,"No , but my little brother likes it very much . "
0,It's really a good book . You will like it too . 
0,"I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . "
0,"Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? "
0,Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . 
0,I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . 
0,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . "
1,"Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . "
0,I guess we'll see just around . 
0,"Ye , I hope so.well . Take it easy . "
0,"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! "
1,I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
0,But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! 
1,Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
0,What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? 
1,"Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! "
0,So he talks about you behind your back ? 
1,Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
0,I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . 
0,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . 
0,"My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . "
1,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! "
0,What is it ? What happened ? 
1,I think someone is stalking me . 
1,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? "
1,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . "
1,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . "
0,Did he leave when you left ? 
1,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
0,"Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? "
0,"Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? "
0,"Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . "
0,"Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . "
0,It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? 
1,"OK , I'd love the company . "
1,This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . 
0,have you ever been to Disneyworld ? 
0,"when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? "
0,"the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . "
0,that's right . Why do you ask ? 
0,"well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . "
0,when are you getting married ? 
0,some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
0,congratulations ! I had no idea . 
0,thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 
0,do you like amusement parks ? 
0,"for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . "
0,"if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . "
0,even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
1,"even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . "
0,thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . 
1,I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
1,Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
1,It's got to be almost a year now . 
1,I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
0,"Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? "
0,Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
1,"Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? "
1,"Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . "
1,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 
1,I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
0,Are you ready to go to the mall ? 
0,Yeah . Dig my new pants ? 
1,"You went out and bought khakis , too ! "
0,No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . 
0,"No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . "
0,I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . 
0,"Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . "
0,"Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? "
0,I think the supermarket is closed now . 
0,"Oh , When does it close ? "
0,It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .
0,"Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 ."
1,Alright . What do you want to do now ? 
1,Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
0,She lives in San Francisco . 
0,How long has she lived there ? 
0,I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
0,That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? 
0,"Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? "
0,Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . 
0,I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ' s not still mad at me . 
0,What did you argue about ? 
0,He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet . 
0,"Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair . "
0,"Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry . "
0,Did you lend him a lot of money ? 
0,"Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . "
0,"Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? "
0,"No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up . "
0,"Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? "
0,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . 
0,I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . 
0,Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . 
0,"No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . "
1,Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? 
1,Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . 
1,They must be amazing animals . 
1,They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . 
1,I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . 
1,They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . 
0,"Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . "
0,"I am not surprised , you eat too much . "
0,And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
0,"No , I wouldn't think so . "
0,I do wish I could lose weight . 
0,"Well , why don't you go on the diet ? "
0,I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
0,Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 
0,Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets 
0,The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . 
0,"It is a new park , isn't it ? "
0,"Yes , how do you know ? "
0,"Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . "
0,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . 
0,"I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . "
0,The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . 
0,Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . 
0,Don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . 
0,Can you ride a horse ? 
0,"Yes , I can . I don ' t ride regularly though . How about you ? "
1,I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
0,"Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . "
0,I see . Can I sit down ? 
0,Of course ! Make yourself at home . 
0,"Please , just call me Tom . "
0,She's upstairs in my room . 
0,Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . 
0,Have you heard of Paul ? 
0,"No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . "
1,"Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . "
0,"Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . "
0,Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . 
0,"If we hurry , can we get there in time ? "
0,Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? 
0,"Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? "
0,"Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . "
0,"Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . "
0,"The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here ."
0,"Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . "
0,Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . 
0,"Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . "
0,"Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . "
1,Tim ' s smiles are interesting . 
1,"Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . "
1,You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
1,How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! 
1,Have you enjoyed your weekend ? 
1,"Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . "
1,Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . 
0,The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . 
0,It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
0,Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . 
0,I ' m forming a music band . 
0,Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
0,"Uh ... Yeah ! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . "
0,"Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? "
0,"We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? "
0,"Yes , I ' m a singer . "
1,Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 
1,"Great ! Wait here ? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? "
0,What would you like for Christmas ? 
0,I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . 
0,Yes and I've written him a letter . 
0,"Lili , let ' s take a vacation ! "
0,"George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ' t have much money left after paying the rent . "
0,"Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much ."
0,"Where will we sleep , then ? "
0,"Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ? "
0,Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ? 
1,The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait ! 
0,"Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet . "
0,"As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . "
1,Let ' s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 
1,You have such good ideas ! 
0,What date will our field trip be on ? 
0,The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
0,"Yes , I will make note of that . "
0,"Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7"
0,I will be there half an hour early . 
0,You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ?
0,"Yes , someone is picking me up . "
0,To get back to campus by 8
0,"Not at the moment — maybe later , though . "
1,All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! 
0,The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . 
0,I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . 
0,Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . 
0,How was your business trip ? 
1,Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
0,Nice to meet you here . How come you dropped into this company today ? 
0,My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise . How long have you been doing this ? 
0,That is great . Do you have to work the night shift ? 
0,"No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . "
0,Do you enjoy work here ? 
0,"It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant . Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . "
0,Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . 
1,Luckily not . The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . 
1,Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . 
0,What's the second solar system ? 
1,"It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . "
0,Is this good news or bad news ? 
1,"It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! "
0,You mean with people on it ? 
0,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
0,"Sorry , I thought you knew . "
0,But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
0,"Well , I am telling you now . "
0,"Yes , but you might have told me before . "
0,I didn't think you would be interested . 
1,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
0,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . "
1,"Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
0,How was the movie last night ? 
1,I didn't really like it . 
0,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
1,I found it very disappointing . 
0,"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . "
1,I wasn't happy with it . 
0,Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
0,"Honey , I ' ll be right back ! "
0,I told you already ! I ' m going to get my nails done . 
0,"Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? "
0,"Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! "
0,Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
0,"They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! "
0,"Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . "
1,"Good afternoon ! Sit down , please . How are you ? "
1,"I'm very well , thank you . How are you ? "
1,"Very well too , thank you very much . Isn ' t it a lovely day ? "
1,"Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . "
0,What's the weather like in your country ? 
0,Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
0,In London . Where do you live ? 
0,I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
0,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 
0,"That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! "
0,Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
0,"Well , no , it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ? "
0,"You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . "
0,"Well , that seems easy enough . "
0,"Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . "
0,"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! "
0,Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
0,I hear that Mary got mad . 
0,What ' s wrong with her ? 
0,She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . 
0,"Um , what will you do this weekend ? "
1,How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . 
0,A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? 
1,No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? 
1,"Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . "
0,What ' s on TV tonight ? 
0,"Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . "
0,Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . 
0,"Oh , come on . That ' s such a girl ' s show . "
0,No it ' s not . It ' s just funny . 
0,"Yeah , if you ' re a girl . "
0,"Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . "
0,That ' s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . 
0,It ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . 
0,"O . K . , O . K . Let ' s forget it . There ' s a football game on too . "
0,No way . I ' m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ' s to watch the game . 
0,What are you talking about ? 
0,Don ' t you see many parents are forcing there children ' s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 
0,You said it . Many parents just don ' t know how to educate their children . 
0,"Sarah , what did you do today ? "
0,"Yes , I bought a few things . "
0,I bought this coat . Do you like it ? 
1,"Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? "
0,At the mall on 5th street .
0,"No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars ."
1,I know . It was a really good deal . 
0,I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . 
0,"Hi , Victor . How are you ? "
0,"So , are you going to go to class tonight ? "
1,Maybe ... but I don't think so . 
1,I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . 
1,"Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . "
1,"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . "
0,He can barely make ends meet . 
0,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
0,They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
0,"If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . "
0,"No way , if it still has 21 ."
0,What's that book you have under your arm ? 
0,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
0,How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
0,I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
0,Is it really worth paying for ? 
0,I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 
0,"If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . "
0,"Come on , you are left behind ! "
0,"Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . "
0,You just need more exercise . 
0,"Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! "
0,I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . 
0,But running so fast is not good for people over forties . 
0,We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . 
0,But I want to burn up more calories ! 
0,"In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . "
1,Really ? I will slow down then . 
0,"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? "
0,"Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? "
0,"I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . "
0,"Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . "
0,"Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . "
1,"It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . "
0,"Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . "
0,Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . 
0,I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . 
0,"Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . "
0,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . "
0,The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . 
0,"Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . "
0,"It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . "
0,Are you an art aficionado ? 
0,"Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ? "
0,"I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . "
0,I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school . 
0,Art isn ' t for everyone . I ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . 
0,"I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you . "
0,I thought I ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
1,That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 
1,Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
0,"What does your mother do , may I ask ? "
0,My mother works in a company as an accountant . 
0,"Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . "
1,"My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . "
1,"I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . "
1,Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . 
1,"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you . "
1,It's a good day for a picnic . 
0,"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? "
0,"Well , come over and talk to me then . "
0,May I turn on the TV then ? 
1,Turn on the TV for what ? 
0,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
1,"Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "
0,"I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . "
1,"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . "
1,Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! 
1,Brian ! How have you been ? 
1,"Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! "
1,"Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . "
1,"Well , you look great ! How are you ? "
1,I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . 
0,How is your new dormitory ? 
1,"It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . "
0,"Well , do you all major in the same subject ? "
0,"No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . "
0,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? "
0,"Well , I swim and run every day . "
0,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ? "
0,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . "
0,Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
0,"Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . "
0,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . "
0,What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
0,We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
0,How hard is the climb ? 
0,It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
0,What did you do last week ? 
0,We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
1,Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it . 
1,"Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . "
1,"Yeah , I will . See you then ! "
0,How many languages can you speak ? 
0,I can speak French and German . 
0,How well can you speak them ? 
0,"I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . "
0,Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? 
0,"No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . "
1,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
0,Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
1,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
0,You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
1,"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! "
0,It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . 
0,Do you really have to work today ? 
0,But you'll miss out on the football game . 
0,"Oh . Well , it can't be helped . "
1,How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! 
0,"Oh , do you really think so ? "
1,"Of course , otherwise you ' ll just have to wait for hours . "
0,But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . 
1,"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . "
1,You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . 
1,"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . "
1,Come on ! You're pulling my leg . 
1,What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . 
1,Is that your wedding ring ? 
1,I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . 
1,"Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? "
1,Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? 
1,"Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . "
1,You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . 
0,What kind of watch is it ? 
0,"If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? "
0,This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
1,That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . 
1,Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
0,I'm really mad at Bob . 
0,"Hi , Jack , how have you been ? "
0,Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? 
0,"Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . "
1,"Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . "
0,"Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . "
1,"Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . "
0,"Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . "
0,"Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! "
1,"Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... "
0,Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
0,Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . 
0,"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . "
0,Excuse me . Do you have the time ? 
0,"My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . "
0,"Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? "
0,"If we start now , we can make it by taxi . "
0,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
0,China beat Brazil three to zero . 
0,"What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . "
0,The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . 
0,"At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . "
0,Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . 
0,"You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . "
0,I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
0,Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . 
0,Is this the sign ? What does it says ? 
0,It says No smoking here . 
0,Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? 
0,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
0,"First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . "
1,That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . 
1,How do you research your books ? 
1,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . 
1,I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
1,Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . 
1,Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 
1,"There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . "
1,Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time . 
0,What shall I call him ? 
0,"Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . "
0,He's checking bags . He ' s an official in the customs . 
1,For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
1,That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! 
1,I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . 
1,That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . 
1,Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . 
0,Will it be an all day event ? 
0,Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . 
1,I'm so glad I bought this watch ! 
1,I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . 
1,Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . 
1,"Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? "
0,Do you take a bus to and from work ? 
0,"Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . "
0,"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . "
0,"Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . "
0,"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . "
0,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
0,"You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! "
0,"And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . "
0,"You were so happy , weren ' t you ? "
0,What do you think ? I ' m a good boy . 
1,We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . 
1,Now let's get things ready . 
1,Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . 
1,That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . 
1,"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . "
1,"Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . "
1,And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . 
0,"Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . "
0,There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . 
0,"That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games ."
0,"Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . "
0,"My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . "
0,"OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . "
0,"Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . "
0,It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . 
0,The boy is good for nothing . 
0,"As a teacher , I don ' t know how to help him . "
0,"Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? "
0,"Not bad . We have had a big meeting today , remember ? "
0,"Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ? "
1,Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . 
0,"Great , so what happens now ? "
1,"Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . "
0,Do you believe in UFOs ? 
0,"Of course , they are out there . "
0,But I never saw them . 
0,"Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . "
0,You mean that you can them . 
0,That's right . I can see them in my dreams . 
0,They come to the earth ? 
0,No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . 
0,Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? 
0,"OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . "
0,That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? 
0,"Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . "
1,"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? "
1,Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
0,"By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . "
1,"Good , happy birthday to you ! "
0,"Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ? "
1,"Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . "

0,Have you just been to the cinema ? 
0,"Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good . "
0,"Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ? "
0,"Yes , I have . I was there in April . "
0,"Paris in the spring , eh ? "
0,"It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . "
0,Just like dear old London ! 
0,They got a divorce at last . 
0,"It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . "
0,You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . 
0,That give us a good lesson . 
0,I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .

0,So you're quite happy with your new job ? 
1,Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . 
0,Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? 
0,"Oh , I ' m afraid I can ' t . I ' Ve had a date already . "
0,May be some other time . 
0,You received a letter in the mail . 
0,Who ' s the letter from ? 
0,I think it ' s my acceptance letter from NYU . 
0,I want to know what it says . 
0,They didn ' t accept me . 
1,I really wanted to get into NYU . 
1,I am really sorry to hear that . 
1,It ' s okay . I ' m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . 
0,Why are you so quiet ? 
1,My girlfriend just broke up with me . 
0,You must feel terrible now . 
0,"I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . "
1,You've been through this too ? 
0,"Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . "
1,But it hurts too much . 
0,"I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . "
0,What if I don't want to find another girl ? 
0,"You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . "
1,"I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? "
1,Yeah . Thanks for the talk . 
1,I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . 
1,Ok . I'll talk to you later . 
0,"Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? "
0,Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .

0,A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ? 
0,"Not bad , But she's as busy as before . "
0,"Whatever we do , we should do it above board . "
0,You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . 
0,"Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . "
1,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! "
1,"Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? "
1,"Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . "
0,I think he's got too much on his plate . 
1,This is the best dinner I've ever had . 
1,I've never tasted anything better . 
1,How nice of you to say so . 
0,"Hey Nick , what are you up to ? "
0,"Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? "
0,Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ' t know man . 
0,"Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ' s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim ."
1,Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 
0,"Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! "
0,"Wow , I didn ' t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! "
0,"The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? "
0,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ' t seen you for a while . "
0,I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back . 
0,I was in New York for a wedding . 
0,Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? 
0,Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
0,"Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? "
0,"Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . "
0,"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . "
1,I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
0,"come on , nothing can be that bad . "
0,"but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . "
0,"ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? "
0,I've fallen in love with my boss . 
0,"no , of course not . He is still single . "
1,I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
0,"oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . "
1,"worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . "
0,office romance is very tricky . 
1,it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . 
0,"cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . "
0,You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? 
0,"Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . "
0,"With everything , with everybody , with all this ! "
0,A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . 
0,"It wasn't always like this , you know . "
0,"Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . "
0,You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . 
1,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . "
1,Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
0,"Yes , I am the guy . "
1,What a bummer ! You set me up ? 
0,Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
1,How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) 
0,"Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! "
1,Why did you lie to me in the email ? 
0,I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
1,I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
0,"I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . "
0,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? "
0,"Well , I swim and run every day . "
0,"Now , tell me , what do you eat ? "
0,"Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . "
0,Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
1,"Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . "
0,"Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . "
0,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
0,China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .
0,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . "
0,I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . 
0,"Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . "
0,"I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . "
0,"It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . "
0,"Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! "
1,Isn't it wonderful walking here ? 
1,I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . 
1,"Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall ."
0,It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 
0,"You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering ."
0,What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 
0,Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . 
0,"Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . "
0,What are they all for ? 
0,"Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . "
0,"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? "
0,I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . 
0,What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? 
0,Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . 
0,And your parents took it badly ? 
0,That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . 
0,"Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? "
0,"She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . "
0,How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? 
0,Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . 
1,Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . 
0,"Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . "
0,"I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . "
1,Do you think they two will get married ? 
1,"Yeah , you can count on it . "
1,"I think so . Yes , they get along so well . "
1,I like him . He's good for her . 
1,You're right . He sure is . 
0,What do you think of Frank ? 
0,He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . 
0,Why do you say that ? 
0,"Whatever things get tough , he gives in . "
0,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . 
0,Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . 
0,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? "
0,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss . Parker speaks to us only in English . "
0,I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 
0,Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
0,It must be interesting to study English . 
1,Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss . Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
0,Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
0,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
0,It's quiet everywhere in winter . 
1,It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
1,That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
1,What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . 
1,Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . 
1,I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . 
1,There is a snowman over there . 
0,"Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players . "
1,"Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! "
1,"Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . "
1,"Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing . "
1,Which team do you think will win ? 
1,The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
0,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr . Stone . "
0,It's ok . What do you want to ask ? 
0,Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? 
0,The first place you should go is the International Center . 
0,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . 
0,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? 
0,"They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . "
0,Can we get any more help at the International Center ? 
0,"Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . "
0,I see . It must be worth going to . 
0,"Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . "
1,Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . 
1,"It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . "
0,I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
0,same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
0,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
0,true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
0,definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
0,"the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . "
0,"inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . "
0,has the government taken some measures to curb it ? 
0,yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . 
0,but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . 
0,you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . 
0,"for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . "
0,"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . "
0,You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . 
0,Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . 
0,You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . 
1,"The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! "
0,"Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . "
0,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 
0,"Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . "
0,"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... "
0,Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
0,That makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
0,Yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
0,Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . 
0,"I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . "
0,"Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . "
1,Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
0,What courses did you take in college ? 
0,"I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . "
0,Which course did you like best ? 
1,I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . 
0,Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? 
0,I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . 
0,Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . 
0,Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? 
0,"That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . "
0,Really . I'll get a computer at once . 
1,We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? 
0,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ? "
0,I ' m afraid this seat is taken . 
0,Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . 
0,You ' re welcome . Why don ' t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? 
0,I prefer potatoes to eggplants . 
0,I feel eggplants are more nutritious . 
0,"But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . "
0,"Oh , that's how you see it . "
0,Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? 
0,"Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . "
0,Where do you plan to go this winter ? 
0,"Oh , yes , you like skiing . "
0,"Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . "
0,You were showing respect and admiration for them . 
0,I wish I were a hero . 
0,"Frank ' s getting married , do you believe this ? "
0,"Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . "
0,"A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . "
0,Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
0,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class . "
0,"Does the class start again , Mam ? "
0,"Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . "
0,"Come on , baby . It ' s time now . "
0,"Mam , another minute , could I ? "
0,Do you have any hobbies ? 
1,"Yes , I like collecting things . "
1,"Oh , that ' s interesting , and but what kind of things ? "
0,"Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on . "
1,Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? 
0,"well , I can ' t just imagine it . "
0,"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? "
0,Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 
0,"Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . "
0,yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
1,"hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . "
1,"exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... "
0,"yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! "
0,"why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . "
1,are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? 
0,"never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? "
1,ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . 
1,wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . 
1,"I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two. It usually happens in bed at night, but I occasionally experience this during the day. I have a benign brain tumor, but the doctor said it is not associated with this."
1,"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house."
1,"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items.  I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn't her fault.  How can I cope with feeling like this?"
1,I am on my own with my daughter. I am so worried and stressed about her.
1,I've been struggling with it for a test and I'm starting to believe it's something mental. What could it be?
1,What can I do to stop grieving my mother's death?  When I am awake I just cry every day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I need help; I am still cry over her.  Will I ever stop crying? It's been 3 years.
1,Why am I so afraid of it? I don't understand.
1,"I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad."
1,"I'm a teenager, and while I've never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I can't go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot."
1,I've become so jaded that I can't control my thoughts. I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks.
1,"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated."
1,I always feel like I'm not good enough and it literally is so hard living. I don't know how to talk to my parents about it.
1,"I am in my mid 30s. I feel I have used only 5% of my potential. I am in film making, but everything is stuck. I've never had a serious relationship. I had worthless jobs. I do a lot of meditation to try to fix it."
1,We've been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker. I don't know how to approach this situation. How do I ask him about it?.
1,"I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me? We're so young, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I'm incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much."
1,"I just got married with my husband. I have four kids of my own, and he accepts me with my kids. I am thankful he loves my kids even though they're not his. Now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past. I know all marriages have problems, but sometimes I feel it's not going to work out if there's no trust. It's hard for me to let go because I love him, but I am getting tired."
1,"I love him so much, and I don't know what to do."
1,"I'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. 

How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?"
1,"I'm a teenager, and I struggle with going out and talking to people. I feel awful about leaving home. I know I can't afford a therapist so I don't know what my problem is, but I think I might have social anxiety."
1,"I was in a relationship with him for three years. My mom doesn't like it because she thinks I'm making a mistake. He got married a few months after we broke up, and now he is divorced. I forgave him for what he did in the past, and he says he's sorry and he really loves me. I love him too, but is it bad that I'm giving him a second chance again?"
1,"It's been almost a year since my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times. I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares."
1,"My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training. He almost throws up every time he sees his poop. He gags and will not go on the toilet. We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the big-boy toilet, but he refuses to use it. When he sits on the toilet, he just sits there forever and only will pee. He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper. I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him. How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress?"
1,"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again.  The social worker's voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back.  Can he just ignore me?"
1,It's especially bad at night time. I am scared of sleeping alone.
1,"How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have?  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has? I've read about this online, but I'd like to understand this from a therapist's point of view."
1,"My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him."
1,"It's the way my mom said I was worth nothing, stupid, no point of being in school. I'm ""lazy little fat."""
1,"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but I'm not ready for another relationship, and I don't know if he ever will want to be more than friends."
1,I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.
1,"At school, it feels like I've lost all my friends, and I've been really weird with my sleeping patterns. I used to cut myself, and I really want to again, but I change in the locker rooms because I don't want anybody to see. I get ticked off easy and overreact. At night, I'm very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff. Please help me. I just want to be happy again, and I feel like I'm starting to fake a smile at school."
1,I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.
1,"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?"
1,I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I'm having bad flashbacks. I'm scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.
1,"I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much."
1,I've been with the mother of my child for years.
1,"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone."
1,"Both of my parents committed suicide together, and I was the one who found them. I suffer from overwhelming depression, which is having an extreme effect on me and my husband's sex lives. He does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex."
1,She works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out.
1,"I was raped repeatedly when I was younger. I told my parents and action was taken, but now that I'm an adult, I suffer from extreme anxiety."
1,"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I'm coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself."
1,"I have high functioning autism and I have been on a lot of dating sites like meet me, match, and zoosk. I haven't had any luck on any of the dating sites I have been on.

 I really want a boyfriend but I don't know what I should do. I just want to be in a relationship. How can I meet someone?"
1,"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn't care less. I think I'm running him away."
1,"I'm an early 20 something year-old virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. He's cheated on me twice: once in the beginning and then four months ago. He wasn't use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasn't sure. We both work at the same job (where we met) and it's with the girl that works with us. I've been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and self-esteem are low, and sometimes I feel like he'll do it again or that he's not ready to be with me. I think about it all over again when I see her. He says he's in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it didn't feel right, and that's when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me. He's contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because he's in a relationship with me.

How do I gain confidence? Should I let him go? If I let him go, I don't want to be sad about it being that we work together. I try to tell myself I'm beautiful every day, and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality, but I don't like the fact that she works there."
1,"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore."
1,"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck."
1,"I'm in my early 20s. My ex's parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one."
1,My boyfriend is seeking therapy. He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues. He has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.
1,"Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for. When I think about what happened, I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me."
1,"My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow. I've attempted to talk to her about it, but she avoids it and doesn't seem to worry about how I feel about it."
1,"I'm currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and Misophonia. Also, I am 99% sure I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. I read the DSM-IV, taken college psychology, etc. I know it in my heart I have them. Is self-diagnosing okay with the right research?"
1,"I'm a teenage gay girl, and I'm in love with a girl a few years older than me. She loves me too, but we're not physically together at the moment. I've been thinking about being transgender soon too, but my family doesn't accept me, so I honestly don't know what to do about that because I feel like I have to constantly hide the real me. It hurts so much to hide the real me. What can I do?"
1,I'm currently dating someone else and I really like him. But I love and miss my ex so much. What do I do?
1,"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes."
1,"I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. I am on my parent's insurance, and they won't let me see a therapist because they don't believe in it."
1,"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month.  I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion.
Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want.
We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile."
1,Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?
1,I don't know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger. That's really the only one i feel.
1,"My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me. 

He says he doesn't love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back. Is there any hope?"
1,"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him.  I also was dealing with an abusive relationship (mentally, physically, and emotionally). Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people.

How can I feel more comfortable around other people?"
1,"I'm having issues with my relative. The police never believe the experiences I have been through because I am only a kid. 

I've even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me. Could you please give me advice?"
1,"Every time my partner gets angry for anything, she takes it out on me. Nothing I do is right, and once she's mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. She says it isn't abuse, it's just angry verbal bashing, and that it's different. It gets worse each time. The names are very vulgar now."
1,"I've been with my partner for 4 years. She's given me no reason not to trust her. But lately I've been overreacting a lot when she's just doing normal things. I think it's triggering my bad past relationships.

How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her?"
1,"I need answers to my anger, possessiveness, and urges.
I am angry all the time. I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was. I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine. I have these urges to hurt someone really bad. I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting. I want to hear their agonizing pained-filled voices. What is wrong with me?"
1,"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?"
1,I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.
1,"I keep being mean to my best friend, and I don't know why all the time. I did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time. Could that be a cause?"
1,"She said she needed space after three days of dating, and she got a boyfriend a week later. I still really miss her, and she told me she still likes me."
1,"I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic.  Can I fix this by myself?"
1,"My husband and I have been together for seven years now. I will be honest: I have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. I recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because I was afraid to tell him what happened. Ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. He gets so mad and ignores me for days. He's really verbally and emotionally abusive. He tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. Should we call it quits? I'm tired of crying, but we have a toddler together."
1,"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful."
1,"She's in her early 20s, and she has a toddler."
1,"I no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fianc'e."
